{{% bgcolor yellow %}}(NOTE TO TW: Remove this topic when moving the new admin content to the main navigation tree. The order of the content should be as follows: All the new content at the beginning, followed by the system configuration and monitoring topics (Data grid clustering, SLA, Logging, Service Grid, Netork Configuration, Monitoring, Metrics, Performance Tuning, Benchmarking, Security, XAP as Windows Service, Troubleshooting). Last should be all the stuff that is part of the legacy admin content (GigaSpaces Management Center, Web Management Console, Administration Tools, and admin content from Security section), under a new header topic. We need to discuss what do do about the Quiesce mode and MemoryXtend topics. Must delete the cluster setup and logging topics for IE.{{% /bgcolor %}}
