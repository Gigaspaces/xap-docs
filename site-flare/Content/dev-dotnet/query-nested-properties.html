        <h1>Nested Properties</h1>
        <p>The <a href="query-sql.html">SQL Query</a> page shows how to express complex queries on flat space entries (entries which are composed of scalar types like integers and strings), but in reality space entries are often composed of more complex types.
For example, a <span class="tc-bold">Person</span> class may have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An <span class="tc-bold">Address</span> property of type <span class="tc-bold">Address</span>, which is a user-defined class encapsulating address details (e.g. city, street).</li>
            <li>A <span class="tc-bold">PhoneNumbers</span> property of type <code>Dictionary&lt;String, String&gt;</code>, encapsulating various phone numbers (e.g. home, work, mobile).</li>
            <li>A <span class="tc-bold">Groups</span> property of type <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>, encapsulating various groups the person belongs to.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An application would likely need to execute queries which involve such properties (e.g. a person which lives in city X, or is part of some group Y, or has a specific home phone number). This page explains how GigaSpaces <a href="query-sql.html">SQLQuery</a> can be used to express such queries.</p>
        <h1><a name="matching-paths">&#160;</a>Matching Paths</h1>
        <p>Matching a nested property is done by specifying a <span class="tc-bold">path</span> which describes how to obtain its value.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose we have a <span class="tc-bold">Person</span> class and an <span class="tc-bold">Address</span> class, and <span class="tc-bold">Person</span> has an <span class="tc-bold">Address</span> property of type <span class="tc-bold">Address</span>:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">[SpaceClass]
public class Person {
    public Address Address {set; get;}
    ......
}

[Serializable]
public class Address {
    public String City {set; get;}
    ......
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Person</span> with an <span class="tc-bold">Address</span> whose <span class="tc-bold">City</span> equals "<span class="tc-bold">New York</span>":</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;( "Address.City = 'New York'");
</code></pre>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Note that other properties (if any) in <span class="tc-bold">address</span> which are not part of the criteria are ignored in the matching process.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The number of levels in the path is unlimited.
For example, suppose the <span class="tc-bold">Address</span> class has a <span class="tc-bold">Street</span> class which encapsulates a <span class="tc-bold">name</span> (String) and a <span class="tc-bold">houseNum</span> (int).
The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Person</span> who live on "<span class="tc-bold">Main</span>" street:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;("Address.Street.Name = 'Main'");
</code></pre>
        <p>Naturally, any other feature of the SQL syntax can be used with paths:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">// Using parameters instead of fixed criteria expressions:
... = new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;("Address.City = ?", "New York");
// Using other SQL comparison operands:
... = new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;("Address.Street.HouseNum &gt;= 10");
// Using SQL composition operands to express compound predicates:
... = new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;("Address.City = 'New York' AND address.street.houseNum &gt;= 10");
</code></pre>
        <p>Paths can also be specified in <span class="tc-bold">ORDER BY</span> and <span class="tc-bold">GROUP BY</span> clauses:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">// Query for Persons in 'Main' street, sort results by city:
... = new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;("Address.Street.Name = 'Main' ORDER BY Address.City");

// Query for Persons in 'Main' street, group results by city:
... = new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;("Address.Street.Name = 'Main' GROUP BY Address.City");
</code></pre><a name="NestedObjectQueryIndexes">&#160;</a>
        <h2><a name="indexing">&#160;</a>Indexing</h2>
        <p>Indexing plays an important role in a system's architecture - a query without indexes can slow down the system significantly. Paths can be indexed to boost performance, similar to properties.
For example, suppose we've analyzed our queries and decided that <span class="tc-bold">address.city</span> is commonly used and should be indexed:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">[SpaceClass]
public class Person {
    [SpaceIndex(path = "City")]
    public Address Address {set; get;}

    ......
}
</code></pre>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Note that since the index is specified on top of the <span class="tc-bold">address</span> property, the <code>path</code> is "<span class="tc-bold">City</span>" rather than "<span class="tc-bold">Address.City</span>".

        <div class="tc-admon-important">
            <p>The type of the nested object must be a class - querying interfaces is not supported.
Nested properties' classes should be <code>Serializable</code>, otherwise the entry will not be accessible from remote clients.</p>
        </div>
        <h1><a name="nested-dictionary">&#160;</a>Nested Dictionary</h1>
        <p>The path syntax is tailored to detect <code>Dictionary</code> objects and provide access to their content: when a property's key is appended to the path, it is implicitly resolved to the property's value (at runtime).</p>
        <p>For example, suppose the <span class="tc-bold">Person</span> class contains a <span class="tc-bold">PhoneNumbers</span> property which is a <code>Dictionary</code>, encapsulating various phone numbers (e.g. home, work, mobile):</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">[SpaceClass]
public class Person {
    public Dictionary&lt;String, String&gt; PhoneNumbers {set; get;}
   ........
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Person</span> whose <span class="tc-bold">PhoneNumbers</span> property contains the key-value pair <span class="tc-bold">"Home" - "555-1234"</span>:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;("PhoneNumbers.Home = '555-1234'");
</code></pre>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>A path can continue traversing from "regular' properties to maps and back to "regular' properties as needed.
Map properties are useful for creating a flexible schema - since the keys in the map are not part of the schema, the map can be used to add or remove data from a space object without changing its structure.</p>

        <h2><a name="indexing-1">&#160;</a>Indexing</h2>
        <p>Paths containing map keys can be indexed to boost performance, similar to "regular' paths.

        <h1><a name="nested-collections">&#160;</a>Nested Collections</h1>
        <p>The GigaSpaces SQL syntax supports a special operand <code>[*]</code>, which is sometimes referred to as the "contains' operand. This operand is used in conjunction with collection properties to indicate that each collection item should be evaluated, and if at least one such item matches, the owner entry is considered as matched.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Arrays are supported as well, except for arrays of primitive types (int, bool, etc.) which are are not supported - use the equivalent nullable type (int?, bool?, etc.) instead.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Suppose we have a type called <span class="tc-bold">Dealer</span> with a property called <span class="tc-bold">Cars</span> (which is a list of strings).
The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Dealer</span> whose <span class="tc-italic">cars</span> collection property contains the <span class="tc-bold">"Honda"</span> String:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Dealer&gt;("Cars[*] = 'Honda'");
</code></pre>
        <p>Now suppose that <span class="tc-bold">Cars</span> is not a collection of Strings but of a user-defined class called <span class="tc-bold">Car</span>, which has a string property called <span class="tc-bold">company</span>.
The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Dealer</span> whose <span class="tc-bold">cars</span> collection property contains a <span class="tc-bold">Car</span> with <span class="tc-bold">company</span> which equals <span class="tc-bold">"Honda"</span>:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Dealer&gt;("Cars[*].Company = 'Honda'");
</code></pre>
        <p>Matching collections within collections recursively is supported as well.
Suppose the <span class="tc-bold">Car</span> class has a collection of strings called <span class="tc-bold">Tags</span>, to store additional information.
The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Dealer</span> which contains a <span class="tc-bold">Car</span> which contains a <span class="tc-bold">Tag</span> which equals "<span class="tc-bold">Convertible</span>":</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Dealer&gt;("Cars[*].Tags[*] = 'Convertible'");
</code></pre>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>
        <h2><a name="multiple-conditions-on-collection-items">&#160;</a>Multiple Conditions On Collection Items</h2>
        <p>The scope of the <code>[*]</code> operand is bounded to the predicate it participates in. When using it more than once, each occurrence is evaluated separately.
This behavior is useful when looking for multiple distinct items, for example: a dealer with several cars of different companies.
The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Dealer</span> which has both a <span class="tc-bold">Honda</span> and a <span class="tc-bold">Subaru</span>:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Dealer&gt;("Cars[*].Company = 'Honda' AND Cars[*].Company = 'Subaru'");
</code></pre>
        <p>You can use parentheses to specify multiple conditions on the same collection item. See examples:
The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Dealer</span> which has a <span class="tc-bold">Car</span> whose <span class="tc-italic">company</span> equals "<span class="tc-bold">Honda</span>" and <span class="tc-bold">color</span> equals "<span class="tc-bold">Red</span>":</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Dealer&gt;("Cars[*](Company = 'Honda' AND Color = 'Red')");
</code></pre>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Writing that last query without parentheses will yield results which are somewhat confusing:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Dealer&gt;("Cars[*].Company = 'Honda' AND Cars[*].Color = 'Red'");
</code></pre>
            <p>This query will match any <span class="tc-bold">Dealer</span> with a <span class="tc-bold">Honda</span> car and a <span class="tc-bold">red</span> car, but not necessarily the same car (e.g. a blue <span class="tc-bold">Honda</span> and a <span class="tc-bold">red</span> Subaru).</p>

        <p>The following example queries for a <span class="tc-bold">Dealer</span> which has a <span class="tc-bold">Car</span> whose <span class="tc-italic">company</span> equals "<span class="tc-bold">Honda</span>" and <span class="tc-bold">color</span> equals "<span class="tc-bold">Red</span>" and one of the Car nested <span class="tc-bold">Tags</span> List equals to "Convertible":</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">... = new SqlQuery&lt;Dealer&gt;("Cars[*](Company = 'Honda' AND Color = 'Red' AND Tags[*] = 'Convertible')");
