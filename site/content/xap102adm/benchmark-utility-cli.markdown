The benchmark example provides a good tool for running performance benchmarks on the cache in various scenarios. This program performs a loop of `write/put` and `read/get` or `take/remove` operations from a space according to a different set of parameters. The result is the average time it took to perform the operations. You can define a sampling rate to allow you to track the intermediate performance while the benchmark example is running. You may also dump the results into a file to be converted into graphs and analyzed using a spreadsheet and analysis tools.

You can find the benchmark in the `<XAP Root>\tools\benchmark` directory.

Typing `run.bat -h` in the console displays:

The following example uses the Map API, puts 1,000 Entries into the space, 1K each, and removes them from the space. A remote space is accessed.


```bash
-map -take -i 1000 -s 1024
```

The following example uses the Map API, puts 1,000 Entries into the space, 1K each, and gets them back into the client three times.

The following example uses the JMS API, sends 10,000 JMS messages into the space (_MessageProducer.send()_), and receives them asynchronously (_MessageListener.onMessage()_) with notifications.


```bash
-i 100000 -notify -objecttype jms
```

The following example uses the JMS API, sends 100,000 JMS messages into the space (_MessageProducer.send()_), and receives them synchronously (_MessageConsumer.receive()_). Throughput is displayed every 10,000 operations.
