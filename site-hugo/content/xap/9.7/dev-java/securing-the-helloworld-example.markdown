If you are new to the **Hello World** example, we suggest to first review the [Your First XAP Application](./your-first-xtp-application.html) tutorial and its [Hello World screen cast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2s8jg_Gufs&feature=relmfu). With this page we provide a short overview of the example, and get you started with applying security aspects to it.

# Overview

We have a processor bean that will process `HelloObjects` - it works with a polling container to talk to with a Space, all inside of a `Helloworld` Processing Unit. External to that process is the `Feeder` application, which gets a remote proxy to the Space and uses it to write objects (#1). The `HelloObject` written to the Space becomes interesting to the polling container. The polling container will take it out of the Space (#2), hand it to the `HelloWorld` processor bean for processing, and then write the results back to the Space (#3). In this case a `ProcessedHelloObject`. Later, our feeder application can read the results (#4) and print them out to the screen.

# What needs to be secured?

Obviously we want to protect the Space data (containing both `HelloObject` and `ProcessedHelloObject`). We need to first define the Space as secured. The processor beans' polling container needs to be granted `Take` access for `HelloObject` and  `Write` access for `ProcessedHelloObject`. Secondly, the `Feeder` which gains a remote proxy to the Space, needs to be granted `Write` access for `HelloObject` and  `Read` access for `ProcessedHelloObject`.

# Securing the Space

Lets define a secured space in `hello-processor/META-INF/spring/pu.xml` by adding the `secured` namespace property. This can also be accomplished by adding the `secured` Space URL property.


```java
<!-- pu.xml -->
<os-core:space id="space" url="/./processorSpace">
   <os-core:security secured="true"/>
</os-core:space>
```

# Granting access to the embedded polling container

Accessing the secured space requires a _principal_. In this case the _principal_ is the processor beans' polling container.
Lets assume the principals' credentials are: `username`="helloProcessor" and `password`="helloWorld".

There are two options for providing the principal credentials. The first, is by adding the credentials in `pu.xml`. The drawback is that the credentials are exposed. The second, which is preferred, is during deployment of the processing unit.


```java
<os-core:space id="space" url="/./processorSpace?secured">
    <os-core:security username="helloProcessor" password="helloWorld"/>
</os-core:space>
```

# Granting access to the Feeder

The `Feeder` in this example is not a processing unit. It is just an external process acquiring a remote proxy to the Space.
Lets take a look at the `Feeder` constructor.


```java
public Feeder(String url){
  IJSpace space = new UrlSpaceConfigurer(url).space();
  this.gigaSpace = new GigaSpaceConfigurer(space).gigaSpace();
}
```

The feeder needs to be granted access for operations it will perform on the remote secured Space. In this case the feeder is the _principal_. Lets assume the principals' credentials are: `username`="helloFeeder" and `password`="feedTheWorld".


```java
public Feeder(String url){
  IJSpace space = new UrlSpaceConfigurer(url).userDetails("helloFeeder", "feedTheWorld").space();
  this.gigaSpace = new GigaSpaceConfigurer(space).gigaSpace();
}
```

# Protecting User/Password

With production environment the user/password used by the application (for database or space access) should be passed into the application at the deploy time. This will make sure the user/password will never be stored on file and be accessible.


```java

<os-core:space id="space" url="/./processorSpace">
</os-core:space>

Using the CLI deploy command supply username and password using the -user and -password.
> gs deploy -secured -user testing -password 1234 myPU.jar
```

Another option, is to set the security username/password as variables at the pu.xml and inject them - for example, via a deploy property:


```java
<os-core:space id="space" url="/./processorSpace">
    <os-core:security username="${myusername}" password="${mypassword}"/>
</os-core:space>

Using the CLI deploy command embed the username and password matching the placeholders given in the pu.xml
> gs deploy -properties embed://myusername=testing;mypassword=1234 myPU.jar
```

# Declaring the principals

Managing the users and their authorities can either be done using the UI or API.

We have two users to declare - "helloProcessor" and the other "helloFeeder".
The "helloProcessor" user will be granted `Take` access for `HelloObject` and `Write` access for `ProcessedHelloObject`.
The "helloFeeder" user will be granted `Write` access for `HelloObject` and `Read` access for `ProcessedHelloObject`

{{% note "Some implementation notes: "%}}

- The `ProcessedHelloObject` is fictive. Actually the `Feeder` waits for `HelloObject` template matching the "Hello World !!" String.
- The `HelloObject` was replaced by a `Message` Object in the products example. Thus the actual class that should be granted privileges for is `org.openspaces.example.helloworld.common.Message`.

Lets look at how easily it can be using the [GigaSpaces Management Center (UI) Security](./gigaspaces-management-center-ui-security.html)

# Running the Example

There are a couple of deployment options. For example deploying using the ant build script or the UI.

{{% info %}}
To simplify this example we will assume that the Service Grid components are **not** secured.
{{%/info%}}

1. Start a GSM
1. Start a GSC
1. Run the build `deploy-processor` target
1. Run the build `run-feeder` target



# Secured Service Grid

To complete this example, we will give a brief overview of what needs to be done to deploy into a secured Service Grid.

In a secured Service Grid, the GSM and GSC are secured. This means that in order to deploy, you must have `Provision PU` privileges. Declare another principal with  `Provision PU`, that will be used for deploying.

Using the UI, _Login_ with this principals' credentials, and open the deployment wizard to deploy the `processor`.
Now, all that is left is to run the feeder as an external application.
