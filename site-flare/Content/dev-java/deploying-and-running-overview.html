        <p>This section describes the various options for debugging and running your Processing Units.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Some of the features discussed here are not part of the open-source edition, and are only available in the licensed editions (starting with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAPPrem" />).</p>
        </div>
        <p>In production, your Processing Units run on the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> service grid, taking advantage of its SLA and monitoring capabilities. However, when developing your application, you typically want to run it from within your IDE or in a more lightweight mode that will not require you to start a complete runtime environment.</p>
        <p>The abstraction that enables running the same Processing Unit in different modes (service grid, within your IDE, etc.) is called <span class="tc-italic">Processing Unit Containers</span>.</p>
        <p>Naturally, the <a href="../overview/the-runtime-environment.html#gsc">Grid Service Container</a> implements its own Processing Unit container, allowing for Processing Units that are provisioned to it to run properly.</p>
        <p>In addition, to facilitate easier development and debugging, GigaSpaces provides two more Processing Unit containers. The <span class="tc-italic">Integrated Processing Unit Container</span> allows you to debug and run your Processing Units within your IDE in an isolated, easy-to-use mode. The Integrated Processing Unit Container is simply a class with a main method, which instantiates a Spring application context for your Processing Unit and makes sure other services (such as <a href="obtaining-cluster-information.html">cluster information</a>) is available to your code as if it was running in a real cluster.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the standalone Processing Unit container also runs your Processing Units in a simple isolated environment, allowing you to start and stop them quickly to avoid the overhead of starting a full-blown cluster.</p>
        <p>Both the Integrated Processing Unit Container and the standalone Processing Unit run as a standalone Java process, and therefore cannot enforce any of the <a href="../admin/the-sla-overview.html">SLA requirements</a> of the Processing Unit. Their primary purpose is to enable you to debug and unit test your Processing Units.</p>
