        <h3><a name="service-grid"></a>Service Grid</h3>
        <p>A built-in orchestration tool which contains a set of Grid Service Containers (GSCs) managed by a Grid Service Manager. The containers host various deployments of Processing Units and data grids.
Each container can be run on a separate physical machine. &#160;This orchestration is available for Smart&#160;Cache only. For Smart DIH, we recommend using our Kubernetes orchestration.</p>
        <h3><a name="grid-service-container-gsc"></a>Grid Service Container (GSC)</h3>
        <p>A component that hosts Processing Unit instances. A machine can run one or more GSC processes. Each GSC communicates with a manager component (GSM which is part of the <a href="../admin/xap-manager.html">GigaSpaces Manager</a>). The GSC receives requests to start/stop a Processing Unit (PU) instance, and sends information about the machine that runs it (operating system, processor architecture, current memory and CPU stats), the software installed on it, and the status of Processing Unit instances currently running on it.</p>
        <h3><a name="grid-service-manager-gsm"></a>Grid Service Manager (GSM)</h3>
        <p>The GSM is a part of the <a href="../admin/xap-manager.html">GigaSpaces&#160;Manager</a> that manages and monitors deployments of Processing Units (PUs). </p>
