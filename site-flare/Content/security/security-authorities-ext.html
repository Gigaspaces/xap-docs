<h1>Administration Authorities</h1>
  

<p>The Premium and Enterprise editions provide administration authorities for managing and monitoring the grid.
For example, a user may have a <code>Grid Authority</code> of type <code>Provision PU</code>, which allows it to deploy and un-deploy in the Grid.</p>

<h1><a name="grid-authority">&#160;</a>Grid Authority</h1>

<p>The <span class="tc-bold">Grid Authority</span> consists of privileges for managing the Grid and its Services (GSMs, GSCs, Processing Units).</p>

<td>Provision PU</td>

<td>Manage PU</td>
<td>Scale up/down, Relocate, Restart PU instance, Destroy PU instance</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Manage Grid</td>
<td>Start, Terminate, Restart of GSC/GSM/LUS via GSA</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In distributed systems, it may be confusing as to which service is performing the authorization. The GSM is responsible for deploying, un-deploying, scaling, relocating, restarting and destroying of processing units. The GSA (if available) is responsible for starting, terminating restarting of GSC/GSM/LUS. The GSC on the other hand, mainly delegates the calls to the managing GSM (e.g. relocate).</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>When deploying an <a href="../dev-java/elastic-processing-unit-overview.html">elastic processing unit</a>, the <span class="tc-italic">Provision PU</span> privilege is not enough - <span class="tc-italic">Manage PU</span> and <span class="tc-italic">Manage Grid</span> are required as well, since an elastic PU requires scaling and grid management.</p>
</div>

<h1><a name="monitor-authority">&#160;</a>Monitor Authority</h1>

<p>The <span class="tc-bold">Monitor Authority</span> consists of privileges for monitoring the Grid and its Processing Units.
Note that the monitoring is secured only by the "tooling' (CLI/UI).</p>
