        <h1>Slow Consumer</h1>
        <p>The Space includes a special mechanism that detects clients that cannot consume the notifications sent fast enough - i.e. slow consumers.</p>
        <h1><a name="handling-slow-consumers"></a>Handling Slow Consumers</h1>
        <p>Traditionally, messaging-oriented middleware products have several methods for handling slow consumers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Blocking or slowing down the producer</li>
            <li>Spooling messages to disk and replaying at a later time</li>
            <li>Discarding messages for the slow consumer</li>
            <li>Dropping the slow consumer</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Options 1-3 can be very costly in terms of performance and reliability. The options that guarantee reliability and consistency are blocking or slowing down the producer and spooling messages to disk and replaying at a later time.</p>
        <p>These solutions have a very high price in terms of performance and scalability, that doesn't just affect the slow consumers, but also the entire cluster. Spooling messages to disk and replaying at a later time is considered more popular due to the fact that it affects the performance of the non-slow consumers indirectly, whereas when blocking or slowing down the producer the effect is direct and costly. These are the most common ways slow consumers are handled in the messaging world.</p>
        <p>With <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> <span class="tc-bold">In-Memory-Data-Grid*, options 1-3 are not be relevant, since in most cases the requirement is to maintain a *consistent local image</span> of a data set at the client side. Updates for this data set are sent into the client via notifications. This local view should be accessible to the client when there is a connection failure or a slow consumer running.</p>
        <p>A different approach to handle slow consumers is to drop the client identified as a slow consumer, later allow it to <span class="tc-bold">get a snapshot of the current state</span> of the data set from the server, and continue to receive updates from that point onward.</p>
        <p>This approach is not feasible with traditional messaging systems, since the notion of "current-state' does not exists. The space on the other hand, maintains the current state inevitably and therefore it makes much more sense to handle slow consumer by <span class="tc-bold">disconnecting it from the space server</span>. Once the client is ready, allow it to reconnect, initializes its status by reading the relevant data set from the space, re-register for notifications and resume the notifications delivery.</p>
        <h1><a name="how-does-it-work"></a>How Does It Work?</h1>
        <p>When sending notifications to clients, the space includes a special mechanism that detects clients that cannot consume the notification sent fast enough - i.e. a slow consumer.</p>
        <p>Slow consumers can cause problems, since they force the space to keep the notification in memory till all consumers consumed the event. Once the space process memory is full, the space is forced to slow down the response to clients, causing fast consumers to slow down. In extreme cases, this behavior might eventually cause the space process to exit abnormally with an out-of-memory error.</p>
        <p>When the Slow Consumer is enabled, once the space detects a slow consumer, it automatically disconnects the slow consumer, cancel its notification registration and enforce it to reconnect (re-register for notifications). This ensures that fast consumers are not affected by the slow consumer behavior.</p>
        <p>Slow consumers are determined by measuring the network consumption throughput (configured via the <code>com.gs.transport_protocol.lrmi.slow-consumer.throughput</code> parameter) sent from the space into a client. Once the space detects a client that consumes notifications below the defined throughput, it waits for a specified duration (configured via the <code>com.gs.transport_protocol.lrmi.slow-consumer.latency</code> parameter) for it to recover. The space tries to determine several times (configured via the <code>com.gs.transport_protocol.lrmi.slow-consumer.retries</code> parameter) during the wait period if the client recovered - if it is still below the defined throughput, then its notify registration is forcibly canceled.</p>
        <div class="tc-align-center">

                <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/IMG230.jpg" alt="IMG230.jpg" class="tc-picture50" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>To allow the client to detect that the space removed its notify registration, it should register the notification using a short lease and renew it manually or automatically. See the Notify Container <a href="../dev-java/notify-container-overview.html">Java version</a> |<a href="../dev-dotnet/notify-container-overview.html"> .NET version</a> or the <a href="../dev-java/session-based-messaging-api.html#advanced-options">Session Based Messaging API</a> for details how to renew the registration lease automatically. If the lease renewal failed, it means the space canceled the notification. In this case, the client should remove the current listener to cleanup its resources and then re-register for notify registration.</p>
        <p>The LRMI thread pool queue size parameter, measured in <span class="tc-bold">Objects</span>, configures the client and space server communication queue maximum size when processing incoming requests.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>In general, you should have a different LRMI thread pool queue size value for clients and for the space server.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When the LRMI thread pool queue size in the client side reached its limit (client can't consume incoming notifications), the client will stop consuming incoming network packets. This in return will initiate the slow consumer mechanism at the space side that will cancel the client notify registration.</p>

            <p>You may have to alter the default slow consumer parameters according to the specific scenario.
Ensure that you are not adding the services.config file to your server class path, as this may cause the slow consumer to be turned on by default.</p>
