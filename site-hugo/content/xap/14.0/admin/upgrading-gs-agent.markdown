The 12.3 release has introduced a new [Command Line Interface](tools-cli.html), which provides the [host run-agent](admin-service-grid-agent.html) command for starting a GigaSpaces agent on the current host. 

The [legacy gs-agent](the-runtime-environment.html) script is still supported, but starting v14.0 it is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Customers upgrading from older versions are encouraged to upgrade to the new CLI command.

To get started with the new CLI command, simply run `xap host run-agent --help` from the product's `bin` folder.
