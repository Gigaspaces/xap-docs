[Management Center](./gigaspaces-management-center.html){{<wbr>}}
GigaSpaces Management Center is a GUI that allows you to view spaces, containers, and clusters and configure them, using the Space Browser tab. You can also deploy and manage services using the Deployments tab.

[Web Management Console](./web-management-console.html){{<wbr>}}
The web management console is a new user interface for XAP allowing users to deploy, manage and monitor their Processing Units and Applications

[Data grid clustering](./data-grid-clustering.html){{<wbr>}}
This section describe into details how the In-Memory-Data-Grid clustering works. It goes into the details of the fail-over, load-balancing, and replication facilities used.

[Service Level Agreement](./the-sla-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
The XAP runtime environment (Service Grid) provides Service Level Agreement driven capabilities.

[Memory Management](./memory-management-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
In this section we will explain the different Space cache policies, memory usage, and rules for exceeding physical memory capacity.

[MemoryXtend](./memoryxtend-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
XAP 10 introduces a new Storage interface allowing Blob/Block/external type storage to act as a natural memory space for the IMDG.



[Logging](./logging-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
This section explains how you can configure logging with XAP. We will show you how you can format the log output, choose file names and rollover policies.

[Administration tools](./administration-tools.html){{<wbr>}}
This guide will explain the command line interface that is used to deploy, manage and monitor Processing Units and Applications.

[Runtime configuration](./runtime-configuration.html){{<wbr>}}
This section lists and explains the different runtime configuration parameters.

[Network Configuration](./network.html){{<wbr>}}
In this guide we will explain how to configure the network in order for XAP to work properly .

[Monitoring](./monitoring.html){{<wbr>}}
In this guide you will find information on how to monitor XAP and your deployed application.

[Performance Tuning](./tuning.html) {{<wbr>}}
In this guide you will find information on how to tune your XAP application. Amongst the topics covered are JVM tuning, thread usage and benchmarking.

[Benchmarking](./benchmarking.html){{<wbr>}}
Performance benchmarks with XAP's In-Memory Data Grid mainly involve testing latency and throughput.

[Quiesce Mode](./quiescemode.html){{<wbr>}}
Processing Units can be configured to be put into maintenance mode. Once a processing unit has entered into maintenance mode, it will reject all data-related operations with an exception. This is useful when performing a safe shutdown or for a rolling system upgrade.


[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.html){{<wbr>}}
In this guide you will find useful information on how to troubleshoot your XAP application.

[Moving into Production Checklist](./moving-into-production-checklist.html){{<wbr>}}
