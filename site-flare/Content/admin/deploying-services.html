        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Deploying Services</h1>
        <p>There are several types of Services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Stateful PU/Service - This is space containing data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stateless PU/Service - These are built-in services such as mirror wan-GW, data-GW and custom services</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Client Services - These are applications which interact with spaces</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is also possible to develop new services based on <a href="../started/first-data-grid.html">Blueprints</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Low-Code  Micro-Services </h3>

        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>The creation of low-code micro-services is relevant for Smart DIH only. &#160;It is recommended to use this method to start stateless services.</p>

        <p>Through <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> SpaceDeck, easy low-code data access micro-services can be created. For more information, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-services.html">SpaceDeck – Services</MadCap:xref></p>

        <h2>Service Creator </h2>
        <p>Services creation is managed by a Service&#160;Creator which, functioning as a RESTful application, manages the entire service deployment cycle.</p>
        <p>The ServiceCreator service manages service creation. The service exposes the REST&#160;endpoints, and is deployed in the environment via the Kubernetes orchestration.</p>
        <p> Any new service creation request generates a new resource of the kind QueryService by submitting a request to the ServiceCreator service <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">Via the SpringBoot REST&#160;application</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p>ServiceCreator service exposes the following APIs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Deploy Query Service given Spec.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Get service spec-parameters given its ID.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Get list of available services of this kind (queryService).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Delete service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Version.16-4-born">Download logs of the service (using path <code>/{serviceId}/logs</code></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
