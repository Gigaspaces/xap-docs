# General Parameters




| Property | Description | Default Value |
|:---------|:------------|:--------------|
| `replication-mode` | Optional values: `sync`, `async`.{{<wbr>}}- The `async` mode replicates space operations to target space after the client receives the acknowledgment from the source space for the operation.{{<wbr>}}- The `sync` mode replicates space operations to target space before the client receives the acknowledgment from the source space for the operation. The client getting the acknowledgment for the operation only after all target spaces confirms the arrival of the replicated data.| `async` used with the async-replicated schema. {{<wbr>}}   `sync` used with the sync-replicated, primary-backup and partitioned-sync2backup cluster schema|
| `policy-type` | Optional values:{{<wbr>}}  full-replication - all objects are replicated. {{<wbr>}}  partial-replication - Object that their @SpaceClass configured(replicate = false) will not be replicated. See the [POJO Metadata](./the-space-configuration.html) page for details. This allows you to control replication at a class base level. | partial-replication |
| `repl-find-timeout` | Timeout (in milliseconds) to wait for the lookup of a peer space. This parameter applies only when the space is searched in a Jini Lookup Service. | 5000 \[ms\] |
| `repl-full-take` | If set to `true` the entire object is replicated when take operations is called. If set to `false` only the ID, class information and primitive fields are replicated. This option is valid only when replicating data into a Mirror Service or a backup in non-central DB topology. | false |
| `replicate-notify-templates` | Boolean value. If set to true, the notify templates are replicated to the target space. | true |
| `trigger-notify-templates` | Boolean value. If set to true, the replicated operations will trigger the notify templates and send events to the registered listeners. | false |
| `on-conflicting-packets` | Enum value. If set to **ignore**, the conflicting operations are ignored. If set to **override** the newest operation will override the data in the target. | ignore |

# Asynchronous Replication Parameters


| Property | Description | Default Value |
|:---------|:------------|:--------------|
| `repl-chunk-size` | Number of packets transmitted together on the network when the replication event is triggered. The maximum value you can assign for this property is `repl-interval-opers`. | 500 |
| `repl-interval-millis` | Time (in milliseconds) to wait between replication operations. | 3000 \[ms\] |
| `repl-interval-opers` | Number of destructive operations to wait before replicating. | 500 |
| `async-channel-shutdown-timeout` | Determines how long (in milliseconds) the primary space will wait for pending replication to be replicated to its targets before shutting down.| 300000 \[ms\]  |

# Synchronous Replication Parameters




| Property | Description | Default Value |
|:---------|:------------|:--------------|
| `throttle-when-inactive` | Boolean value. Set to `true` if you want to throttle replicated operations when the channel is in-active (disconnection) | `true` in primary backup `false` in full sync replicated |
| `max-throttle-tp-when-inactive` | Integer value. If the above is true, this will specify the maximum operations per second the throttle will maintain when the channel is in-active (disconnection), if the last measured throughput when the channel was active was higher than that, the measured throughput will be used instead. | 50,000 operations/second |
| `min-throttle-tp-when-active` | Integer value. this specifies the minimum operations per second the throttle can reduce to when the channel is active (during asynchronous state), the throttling when the channel is active is always adapted to the current throughput and size of redolog in order to keep the redolog size decreasing. | 1,000 operations/second |
| `target-consume-timeout` | The timeout time in milliseconds that the target space waits for consuming replication packets. When the timeout expires, replication channel moves to asynchronous state. | 10000 \[ms\] |

# Recovery Parameters


| Property | Description | Default Value |
|:---------|:------------|:--------------|
| `recovery-chunk-size` | Integer value. Defines how many operations are recovered is a single batch | 200 |
| `recovery-thread-pool-size` | Integer value. Defines how many threads are recovering the data during the snapshot process. | 4 |
