        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle"><a name="top"></a>Connect to a Data Source</h1>
        <p>This page explains how to easily connect to data sources and upload data to GigaSpaces. The work flow has three steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select either a database or data warehouse. Define various properties of the data source and the naming of the space and stateful service at <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />.</li>
            <li>Review the data structure within the selected data source and choose the required data to load.</li>
            <li>Choose between two options to deploy and run the system: <ul><li>Download the generated project files, customize as required and deploy </li><li>Automatically deploy at your local machine.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h1><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> target properties</h1>
        <p>The IT administrator define the service and space names within the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIEP" />:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Service name (default is demo) - define the name of the stateful service that holds the Space data</li>
            <li>Space name (default is demo) - define the Space name that will be deployed within the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIEP" /></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Data source properties</h1>
        <p>These properties define the connection to the selected data source. This enables easy connection, review, and selection of data at the source database that is used to create the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> Object Types. <br /></p>
        <p>The data source type allows you to choose from one of the built-in data types connectors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  MySQL</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-5-born">Amazon RDS (MySQL)</li>
            <li> MS SQL</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-5-born">Azure SQL</li>
            <li> HSQL</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-5-born">Oracle</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-5-born">PostgreSQL</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Alternatively, it is possible to select Other to configure a connection to a new data source.</p>
        <h2>Maven properties</h2>
        <p>Defines the JDBC driver’s maven coordinates (group, artifact and version). Note that this will get auto-filled if you select a built-in data type with the latest version at the time of GigaSpaces Ops Manager release, but you can choose an older/newer version if needed.</p>
        <h2>Driver class</h2>
        <p>Defines the JDBC driver’s class name.</p>
        <h2>Hibernate dialect</h2>
        <p>Defines the dialect Hibernate should use to connect to the database. Note that this will get auto-filled if you select a built-in data type, but some databases use different dialects for different versions, so you may need to change it.</p>
        <h2>Connection string</h2>
        <p>Enter a connection string to the location of your source database.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>If the database selected is MYSQL, and if JDK 8u291 or later is used,  then the following text must be added to the connection string:<br /></p>
            <p><code>enabledTLSProtocols=TLSv1.2</code> <br />For example:<br /><code>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/securities_master<b>?enabledTLSProtocols=TLSv1.2</b></code></p>
        </div>
        <h2>Username and Password</h2>
        <p>If your database is secured, enter the user name and password used for the source database.</p>
        <h2>Advanced properties<br /></h2>These properties are required when choosing "other" as the data source.

If you plan to download the generated code you may wish to change this.</p><h3>Hibernate version</h3><p>The version of the Hibernate dependency. Default is the hibernate version currently tested with GigaSpaces.</p><h3>Number of partitions</h3><p>The number of partitions to deploy your blueprint.</p><h3>Memory per instance</h3><p> The size of each partition. The default value is 512 MB.</p><h3>High Availability (HA)</h3><p>Determines if the space should be highly-available (i.e. each partition includes two instances instead of one).</p><h3>Secured</h3><p>Determines if the spaces should be secured. Requires additional manual configuration within the generated code. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/security/index.html">https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/security/index.html</a></p><h3>Mirror</h3><p>Determines if changes to the space are mirrored back to the database.</p><h3>Mirror Memory</h3><p>The Mirror service runs in a separate process. This setting determines how much memory should be configured to its java settings</p><h3>Row limit</h3><p>The maximum number of rows for each table. This is mostly for data exploration scenarios, where you don’t/can’t load all the data from the database to the space.</p><h3>Configure row limit</h3><p>The maximum number of rows for each table</p><h3>MemoryXtend type</h3><p>Determines if memoryXtend should be used to store data in addition to RAM.
