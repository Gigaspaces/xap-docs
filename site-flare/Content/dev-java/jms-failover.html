<h1>JMS Failover</h1>
  

<p>The JMS layer is responsible for handling space failover properly. The goal is to make failover transparent to the JMS client. In a primary-backup architecture, when the primary space fails, the backup space takes its place as the primary space. This switch should be transparent to the client application, so it won't know that failover ever occurred.</p>

<p>However, in some scenarios, the GigaSpaces JMS implementation uses local transactions, which are valid only on a single space. Messages consumed in a transaction are not acknowledged, and messaged produced in a transaction are not sent until the transaction is committed. If a transaction is aborted (rolled back), consumed messages are recovered, and produced messages are disposed.</p>

<p>In case of failover, any transaction related to the space that failed is aborted. Messages produced under the transaction are disposed, and consumed messages are automatically recovered. This cannot be transparent to the client application, since it has to know about it and respond accordingly.</p>

<p>Failover handling in GigaSpaces JMS relates to transactions. The GigaSpaces JMS implementation uses transactions to implement the <code>Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode and transacted sessions. Consumed messages in <code>Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode are acknowledged only when the client calls <code>Message.acknowledge()</code>. Space failure aborts the transaction used at that time, and all unacknowledged messages are redelivered.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>When working in <code>Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode, produced messages are not included in the transaction.</p>
</div>

<p>Transacted sessions also use transactions. Consumed messages are not acknowledged and produced messages are not sent until <code>Session.commit()</code> is called. Failover aborts the transaction used at that time, and as a result, produced messages are disposed and consumed messages are redelivered.</p>

<h1><a name="notifying-the-client-about-failovers"></a>Notifying the Client about Failovers</h1>

<p>When working in <span class="tc-bold">synchronous delivery mode</span>, the JMS layer tries to receive a message from the space when the client calls <code>MessageConsumer.receive()</code>. The JMS layer notifies the client about space failover by throwing a <code>TransactionRolledBackException</code> to the user.</p>

<p>When working in <span class="tc-bold">asynchronous delivery mode</span>, the JMS layer delivers messages to the client by using the <code>MessageListener.onMessage(Message)</code> method.</p>

<p>When using this interface, The JMS layer can't notify the client about the failure. In this case, when the JMS layer detects failover, it calls the connection's <code>ExceptionListener.onException()</code> method, passing it a <code>SpaceLostException</code> object that describes the problem. Clients should register an <code>ExceptionListener</code> with the connection, and look for the <code>SpaceLostException</code>. Without doing so, in case of a failover, asynchronous <code>MessageConsumers</code> might receive recovered messages without knowing about the failover.</p>

<h1><a name="handling-failovers-with-jms"></a>Handling Failovers with JMS</h1>

<p>When using asynchronous <code>MessageConsumers</code>, the client should register an <code>ExceptionListener</code> with the connection. When space failure occurs, if a transaction was aborted, the JMS layer sends a <code>SpaceLostException</code> to notify the client.</p>

<p>When using synchronous consumers, a failover occurs, and a transaction is aborted, the JMS layer notifies the client about it by throwing a <code>TransactionRolledBackException</code> from the <code>receive()</code> method.</p>

<p>If failover occurs during message acknowledgment (when the client calls <code>Session.commit()</code> or <code>Message.acknowledge()</code>), the JMS layer throws a <code>TransactionRolledBackException</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode, the client should react to this exception as it would react to <span class="tc-bold">session recovery</span>.</p>

<p>In case of a single consumer, the next message to arrive is the first unacknowledged message. The <code>JMSRedelivered</code> header of recovered messages is set.</p>

<p>In transacted sessions, the client should react to this exception as it would react to <span class="tc-bold">session rollback</span>.</p>

<p>The client has to resend the produced messages that have been disposed. In case of a single consumer, the next message to arrive is the first unacknowledged message. The <code>JMSRedelivered</code> header of recovered messages is set.</p>
