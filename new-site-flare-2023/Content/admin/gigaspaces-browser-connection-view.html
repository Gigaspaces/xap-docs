        <h1>Connections View</h1>
        <p>The Connections view exposes information regarding all connected and disconnected space proxies.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>It is also possible to retrieve space connections using the <a href="space-gigaspaces-cli.html">space connections</a> command.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The following properties are exposed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Server IP address and port</li>
            <li>Client IP address and port</li>
            <li>Start connection time</li>
            <li>Connection status</li>
            <li>Disconnection time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Connections view is accessible for each space node. The red highlighted rows in the screenshot below are disconnected connections.</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can clean the displayed disconnections and view only live connections by clicking the <span class="tc-bold">Clean disconnections</span> button on the top right.</p>
        <h1><a name="refresh-options"></a>Refresh Options</h1>
        <p>You can choose to refresh the Connection view periodically. Select the desired refresh rate from the drop-down menu. To stop automatically refreshing the Connections view, click the <span class="tc-bold">Stop* button. The refresh activity impacts server performance, so when running benchmarks you might want to stop auto-refresh activity (by clicking the *Stop</span> button). When auto-refresh is running, a green blinking dot is displayed on the right side of the screen.</p>
        <div class="tc-align-center">

            <p>Connections are created for a space <span class="tc-bold">only when a space operation (eg. ping, write, etc.) is invoked</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Information relates only to physical (live) connections. Logical connections will be shown in the future.</li>
            <li>Disconnected connections are calculated and displayed only on the client side and are not supplied by MBean methods.</li>
        </ul>
