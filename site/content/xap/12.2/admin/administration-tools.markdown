Developers can deploy, manage, and monitor the XAP Processing Units and applications using a command line interface, which also provides commands for gathering information about the XAP runtime components. The interactive command line tool can be started using the gs.sh/bat command (referred to as XAP CLI).

The following activities are supported by the command line interface:

- [Deploying Processing Units to the Service Grid using REST](./deploy-rest.html)
- [Deploying elastic Processing Units](./elastic-deploy-command-line-interface.html)
- [Deploying the REST service](./rest-deploy-command-line-interface.html)
- Performing various [Space maintenance activities](./space-gigaspaces-cli.html)
- Placing a Processing Unit in [maintenance (Quiesce) mode](./quiesce-command-line-interface.html)
