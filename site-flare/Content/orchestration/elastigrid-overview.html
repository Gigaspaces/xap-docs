        <p>This section describes how to deploy  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> using ElastiGrid, which is one of the supported deployment options of the GigaOps stack. ElastiGrid provides container orchestration so you can deploy, manage and scale your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> cluster.</p>
        <p>ElastiGrid can be used to deploy <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> in the cloud, on premise, or in hybrid environments, and supports multi-region connectivity so you can replicate data between regions and cloud-based clusters. </p>
        <p>ElastiGrid provides auto-provisioning and installation with built-in monitoring. You benefit from declarative software installation and orchestration, so you can focus is on writing the type of software you want to install and its requirements in terms of memory and CPU, and ElastiGrid installs and manages your software on the cluster according to the constraints that you defined. As the cluster changes, the ElastiGrid make adjustments, so your infrastructure is always suited to your workload demands.</p>
        <p>ElastiGrid collects metrics on the host machines and all the software defined on the nodes, and displays them using built-in Grafana dashboards. As ElastiGrid uses standard metrics tools, you can easily design your own dashboards in addition to those that <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> provides. Additionally, ElastiGrid can perform rolling upgrades, so there is zero downtime of the system. You can use the Grafana dashboards to monitor performance before and after upgrade, or during canary deployment of your software.</p>
        <p>ElastiGrid is integrated with Zipkin, and distributed tracing system that you can use to troubleshoot latency issues.</p>

## Using Apache Zeppelin with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />

Apache Zeppelin is a multi-purpose web notebook that supports data ingestion and discovery, as well as data analytics, visualization, and collaboration.

Apache Zeppelin contains a built-in Apache Spark integration. This provides the following:

- Automatic SparkContext and SQLContext injection
- Runtime JAR dependency loading from the local file system or Maven repository
- Ability to view job progress and cancel jobs 

The Zeppelin notebook packaged with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> includes several <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> demo applications, along with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />-specific settings that can be configured in the Spark interpreter in order to establish the connection between Spark and the data grid. 

KubeGrid runs Apache Zeppelin in a dedicated Pod, to enable ???
