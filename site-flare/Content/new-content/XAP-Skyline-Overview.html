        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" /> runs server side processing, providing the high performance of advanced operations and avoiding data retrieval back to the client side. Aggregation is performed in-memory, on relevant data only, regardless of total data size. It uses <a href="../overview/space-based-architecture.html">Space-Based Architecture</a> (SBA) as a primary design pattern. With SBA, applications are built out of a set of self-sufficient units, known as <a href="../dev-java/the-processing-unit-overview.html">Processing Units</a> (PU). These units are completely independent of each other, so that an application can scale without increasing complexity, just by adding more units. SBA is based on the Tuple Space paradigm. SBA follows many of the principles of Service-Oriented Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture, as well as elements of grid computing.</p>
        <h1>Reducing Latency&#160;</h1>
        <p>Typically cloud native offerings add a lot of flexibility, scalability and availability. &#160;However, this comes at a cost of latency which has a direct impact on the bottom line in terms of conversion and downtime cost. &#160;<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" /> improves database latency by bringing the critical data closer to the application into the Kubernetes cluster which improves latency by up to 90% which in turn enhances reliability and reduces costs. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" />;s architecture is specifically optimized for minimizing latency and maximizing throughput within Kubernetes environments. Its data management strategies are tailored for cloud-native applications, providing faster access to data and improving overall application responsiveness.</p>
        <p> <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" /> reduces latency by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Bringing your critical data closer to the application into the Kubernetes cluster  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Running the data in-memory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Processing the data locally, thus reducing the chances for failure, by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Collocating the data processing in the same process as the data.</p>
                        <div class="tc-admon-note">
                            <p>This is an advanced capability that maximizes latency reduction. </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Requiring no network calls or serialization overhead.</p>
