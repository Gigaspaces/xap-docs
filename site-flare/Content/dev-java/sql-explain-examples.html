        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>In the PostgreSQL Explain Analyze and Explain Plan examples provided on this page, the following terminology is utilized:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;" class="tc-standard">
            <col style="width: 353px;" />
            <col style="width: 1433px;" />

                <tr>
                    <th>Terminology</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>INDEX&#160;Scan</td>
                    <td>This technique involves scanning data based on a particular index. If a condition is present and the corresponding property is indexed, this scanning method should be employed.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>FULL&#160;Scan</td>
                    <td>
                        <p style="font-size: 12pt;">This approach entails a comprehensive scan of the entire related table, If there is a filter fetching only some of the table data, considers adding a related index to improve performance. </p>

                                <p style="font-size: 12pt;">Executing Explain Analyze provides details of the time it takes to retrieve records from the table and how many records are fetched in that time. For example: (time=6ms rows=514). </p>
                            </li>

                                <p style="font-size: 12pt;">Efforts should be made to reduce query execution time by leveraging indexes. Additionally, optimize the query's table definition to minimize the number of rows returned, ensuring all filtering conditions are properly applied. Refer to <a href="data-query-DQL.html">Data Query Guidelines</a> for additional tips.</p>

                <tr>
                    <td>Broadcast Table (collocated joins)</td>
                    <td>When dealing with a small table intended for joining with others, it is advisable to define it as a broadcast table. In this scenario, rather than transferring all the data to the client and executing the join there, the join operation occurs within each partition, minimizing unnecessary data movement. Refer to <a href="broadcast-objects.html">Broadcast Objects</a> for additional information.</td>

        <p>Below are several examples of queries  using PostgreSQL Explain Analyze and Explain Plan. Each query is followed by its analysis.</p>

                <p>In this Explain Analyze, the Department table is a broadcast table. This means that every partition in our distributed system has a full copy of the Department table. The query fetches products whose prices are above a certain threshold and retrieves the related department details.  If the expensive products were only in a few departments, we could fetch only the relevant department details. Additionally, if we add a condition on the department, the server can filter the products, reducing the amount of data sent to the client.  If the Department table was not broadcast, we couldn't do this server-side filtering and would have to send all the data to the client and filter it there.</p><pre><code class="language-sql"><b>explain analyze for</b> select  D.name as Department, P.name,  P.price from (Select name,price,depId  from "com.gs.Product"  where price &gt; 100 )

                <p>This plan shows us, that there is INDEX scan for the Product table by using the price field, that should have ORDERED index (otherwise index would not be used). This INDEX scan was executed for 1 ms and respond with 6 rows to the client side. There was FULL SCAN for table Department, it was executed for 1 ms and respond with 4 rows to the client side. And then JOIN operation was performed using hash join algorithm for comparing the id field from Department with depId field from Product.
