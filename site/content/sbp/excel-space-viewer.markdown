# Using Excel Space Viewer

The Excel Space Viewer allows you to create views of data to a certain space class. The generated view is a tabular representation of the displayable class fields, numeric and textual types. In the view, each class field is represented by a column, and each row in this column represents an instance of the class.

{{<infosign>}} Field values that are not of a numerical, textual or dates will not be displayed. This includes collections, arrays, user defined types or any other complex objects.

{{<infosign>}} It is possible to create several views in the same spreadsheet. All views can display data for the same space, or for different spaces. If you are displaying data for a different space, you need to connect to that space before creating an additional view.
The Space Viewer toolbar includes the following options:

- [Create View](#creating-new-view) -- allows you to create and customize a new view
- [Configure View](#changing-existing-view) -- allows you to edit and customize existing views
- Refresh results -- refreshes the view or views with updated data

## Creating New View

The **Create View** option allows you to create a view of space data inside your Excel spreadsheet, and to customize your selection according to your requirements.

- The **Connected to** drop-down menu displays the space URL of the space you are currently connected to.
- The **Work with Class** drop-down menu allows you to select which space class you would like to view.
- The **Available Columns** area lists all fields in this class.
- The **Undisplayable Columns** area lists fields that belong to this class, but can't be displayed in Excel (usually user-defined fields).
- The **Selected Columns** area displays the fields you choose to display in this view. Use the arrow buttons (for example: ![arrowExcel.jpg](/attachment_files/sbp/arrowExcel.jpg)) to move columns back and forth. The buttons with two arrows (for example: ) move all of the columns from one area to the other. The up and down arrows on the right (for example: ![excelUpArrow.jpg](/attachment_files/sbp/arrowExcel.jpg)) to move columns back and forth. The buttons with two arrows (for example: ) move all of the columns from one area to the other. The up and down arrows on the right (for example: ![excelUpArrow.jpg](/attachment_files/sbp/arrowExcel.jpg)) allow you to organize the fields in the order in which they will appear in the final view.

- It is possible to connect to any running space in your network.
To connect to a space:
    1. Click the **Connect** button.
    1. In the Connect to Space dialog box, type the [space URL]({{%latestjavaurl%}}/the-space-configuration.html). The general format of the space URL is:

```java
        <protocol>://<host name>:<port>/<container name>/<space name>?<properties>
```

{{% anchor create %}}
To create a new view:

1. Click the **Create View** option in the Space Viewer toolbar. The Create View window is opened.
2. Make sure you are connected to a space.
3. Use the arrow buttons ( ![arrowExcel.jpg](/attachment_files/sbp/arrowExcel.jpg)) to move columns from the **Available Columns** area to the **Selected Columns** area.
4. If you want to narrow your view to more specific results (by querying your class fields), click the **Customize the Selection** button (see [**Customize the Selection**](#customize-the-selection)).

{{<infosign>}} This step is optional. If you want to generate the view with all the existing entries of the selected type in the space, proceed to the next step.
    1. On the left side of the Customize the Selection window, click the class field you want to query. (For example, the **Age** field is selected below.)

{{% align center %}}
![CustomizeTheSelection1.jpg](/attachment_files/sbp/CustomizeTheSelection1.jpg)
{{% /align %}}

    2. The selected field appears on the right, under **WHERE**. You can now select the desired expression and value, and choose to sort your results in an ascending or descending manner.
    3. When you've finished selecting, press **Save**.
    4. Your query syntax is shown in the **SQL** area. Under the **SQL** box, the number of instances (the query's result) is displayed.
    5. Repeat steps 1-4 for any additional fields you'd like to query.
    6. Click **OK**.

5. In the Create View window, Click **OK**.
6. Your selection is displayed in the spreadsheet:
![ExcelSheet1.jpg](/attachment_files/sbp/ExcelSheet1.jpg)

{{<infosign>}} This view displays the selections you made in the Create View and Customize the Selection windows. The view is constantly refreshed (according to the last refresh rate you defined.).

{{<infosign>}} You can use all Excel capabilities on this list, such as column sorting and list. However, **column sorting is not saved when you update your view**.

## Customize the Selection

The Customize the Selection window allows you to perform queries on a certain field, and thus narrows the final view that is displayed in your workbook.

The top left pane is listing all the class fields. At the top of this list is the class name (in the example below: **GigaSpacesViewer.Person**).
By clicking a field, the top right pane is enabled with customization options for that field.

- The **WHERE** statement is displayed, under which is the name of the selected field in bold.
- The **Expression** drop-down menu allows you to select the expression for this query (such as larger than, equals to for integer fields; and like for string fields).
- The **Value** drop-down menu allows you to select the value for your query.
- The **Sort** drop-down menu defines if this column will be displayed in an ascending or descending manner.

Pressing **Save** saves the query for this field.

The **SQL** area at the bottom displays the query syntax in SQL. After pressing **Save** on the right, the number of instances found as a result of this query is displayed under the **SQL** area (this is also the number of rows that will appear in this column). You can refresh this result using the refresh button ( ![ExcelRefresh.jpg](/attachment_files/sbp/ExcelRefresh.jpg)).

## Changing Existing View

The **Configure View** option allows you to make changes to existing views. If you have a few views in the same spreadsheet, click anywhere in the relevant view and then click **Configure View**.

The Configure View window already includes your previously selected options, and you are free to change them as you like.
