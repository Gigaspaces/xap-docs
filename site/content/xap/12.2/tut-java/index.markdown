[Installation](./installation.html)<br>
You will learn   how to download and install XAP.
 
  
  
[XAP in 5 minutes](./xap-java-in-5-minutes.html)<br>
This tutorial explains how to deploy and use a XAP [Data Grid](/product_overview/the-in-memory-data-grid.html) from a Java client application.

[Interacting with the Space](./java-tutorial-part1.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will demonstrate how to create a Space and how you can interact with it. We will also demonstrate how you can improve your space search performance by using indexes and returning partial results.
 

[Deploying a Space](./java-tutorial-part2.html)<br>
In the previous section  you have learned about XAP's capabilities as a data store. In this part of the tutorial we will show you how you can deploy an In Memory Data Grid (IMDG) that provides scalability and failover.

[Distributed Processing](./java-tutorial-part3.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will introduce you to the different processing services you can run on top of the Space.

[Event-Driven Programming](./java-tutorial-part4.html)<br>
The Spaces Messaging and Events support provides messaging handlers that simplify event driven programming.

[Creating a Processing Unit](./java-tutorial-part5.html)<br>
The PU is the fundamental unit of deployment in XAP. The PU itself runs within a Processing Unit Container and is deployed onto the Service Grid. Once a PU is deployed, a PU instance is the actual runtime entity.

[Transactions and Concurrency](./java-tutorial-part6.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will introduce you to the transaction processing capabilities of XAP.

[Persist to Database](./java-tutorial-part7.html)<br>
There are many situations where space data needs to be persisted to permanent storage and retrieved from it.

[Deploy a Web App](./java-tutorial-part8.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will show you how you can deploy a standard WAR file onto the Service Grid.

 
[Security](./java-tutorial-part10.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will introduce you to XAP security, where it fits in the XAP architecture, which components can be secured, and how to configure and customize the security depending on your application security requirements. XAP Security provides comprehensive support for securing your data and services.


[HTTP Session Sharing](./http-session-sharing.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will show you how you can globally share HTTP sessions with XAP.

[Multi-Tiered Data Storage (SSD)](./blobstore.html)<br>
This guide describes the general architecture and functionality of this storage model that is leveraging both on-heap, off-heap and SSD implementation, called MemoryXtend.
