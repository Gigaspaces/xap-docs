This page explains GigaSpaces’ product lifecycle's End-of-Life (EOL) policy relating to GigaSpaces' products and related third-party products, extended support, upgrade path, and [available assistance](http://www.gigaspaces.com/services-offering-overview). The page also provides a product support roadmap to assist GigaSpaces' customers with future planning. All customers should refer to the specific service list they purchased to determine the specific level of support to which they are entitled.

#### GigaSpaces XAP Lifecycle Policy

The common GigaSpaces XAP product lifecycle policy is based on the following guidelines (unless stated otherwise in your service contract):

- New policy change: For all XAP versions, GigaSpaces provides technical product support for 2 years, starting from next upcoming public GA of the release of the relevant product version.
- Effective as of the official Support Discontinuance Date (2 years starting from next upcoming public GA) these versions will no longer be supported under a standard support agreement. Extended Support may be available for an additional limited period, for an extra fee. Please contact GigaSpaces' Customer Service for more information.
- Maintenance releases (Service Packs) are scheduled to be publicly available every 6-8 weeks and are driven by customer feedback. The above, is the planned schedule however does not constitute a firm commitment to produce a release at every such interval.
 
 
####  End-of-Life Policy
 
GigaSpaces products reach the end of their Product Lifecycle for a number of reasons, including product evolution due to market requirements, and replacement by more advanced versions with richer functionality.


GigaSpaces recognizes that end-of-life milestones often have a broad impact on GigaSpaces' customers in their IT environment. With that in mind, we have put out a long-term end-of-life policy, which we publish in advance, to assist customers with the management of their transition to newer versions, and to help customers understand how GigaSpaces' Customer Service can help with the migration of applications.
 

#### Extended Support 
 
- Extended Support (beyond the Support Discontinuance Date) enables you to upgrade your systems to the most recent version, beyond the Support Discontinuance Date. Extended Support may be available for a limited period, for an extra fee. It includes telephone support and access to a web support portal.
- During this time, temporary patches will be available, but service packs are not planned.
- Extended Support and maintenance services for GigaSpaces products are given on the condition that the customer has already paid all the standard support and maintenance service fees owed up to the time Extended Support is required.
- To extend your support beyond a release’s Support Discontinuance Date, please contact GigaSpaces' [Customer Support](mailto:support@gigaspaces.com).

####  JVM & Third-Party End-Of-Life Policy

 
- Java SE 1.4 EOL – based on information made publicly available by Sun Microsystems, as of October 30th 2008, Java SE 1.4 SDK has reached its End of Service Life (EOSL).
- Java SE 1.5 EOL – based on information made publicly available by Sun Microsystems, as of October 30th 2009, Java SE 1.5 SDK has reached its End of Service Life (EOSL).
- Sun also ceased to support the J2SE 1.4 and 1.5 JVMs. In addition, the two other major JVM vendors, namely IBM and Oracle, announced their limited ability to support these JVMs in light of Sun's announcement. This in turn will limit GigaSpaces’ ability to provide support for applications running on these JVMs. However, we will continue to support GigaSpaces XAP editions up to 6.6 (for Java 1.4) and up to version 7.1 (for java 1.5) in these environments on a best-effort basis. Customers concerned about this EOL announcement are encouraged to contact their JDK vendor to explore the extended support entitlements beyond the stated EOL period.
- GigaSpaces recommends that customers upgrade to a fully-supported environment, such as the latest GigaSpaces XAP {{%latestxaprelease%}} and the latest Java 1.7 SDK.
- Please note that from version 7.0 onwards, GigaSpaces XAP will no longer support the Java 1.4 SDK, and will require the use of Java 1.5 SDK or higher.
- Please note that from version 8.0 onwards, GigaSpaces XAP will no longer support the Java 1.5 SDK, and will require the use of Java 1.6 SDK or higher. For details about Java 1.4 & 1.5 SDK EOL, please refer to the following page:http://java.sun.com/products/archive/eol.policy.html
- For more details please refer to the page which discusses the third-party products shipped with GigaSpaces.
