XAP provides an interactive command line tool as part of the product. This can be started using gs.sh/bat command (referred to as **GigaSpaces CLI**).

This tool provides many commands that can be used to manage and gather information about the various GigaSpaces runtime components. This section describes the commands supported by GigaSpaces CLI.

In order to interact with a secured grid you need to login first. See [(CLI) Security]({{%currentsecurl%}}/command-line-interface-cli-security.html).

# deploy PU

## Syntax


```bash
gs> deploy [processing unit jar file / directory location / name]
```

{{% note %}}
The `deploy` command replaces the `pudeploy` command and is identical to it in terms of supported arguments and options.
`pudeploy` is still supported but is considered a deprecated command and will be removed in future versions
{{% /note %}}

## Description

A Processing Unit can be easily deployed onto the Service Grid. In order to deploy a Processing Unit, the Processing Unit must follow the [processing unit directory structure]({{%currentjavaurl%}}/the-processing-unit-structure-and-configuration.html).
Before deploying the processing unit you will need to jar it and then specify that jar file as the parameter to the `deploy` command. The deployment process will upload the jar file to all the GSMs it finds and unpack it under the `deploy` directory. It will then issue the deploy command.

{{% tip %}}
You may use the [GigaSpaces Universal Deployer](/sbp/universal-deployer.html) to deploy complex multi processing unit applications.
{{% /tip %}}

## Third Party jars Location and Property Files

Third party jars should be placed within one of the following locations:

- Within the deployed jar under the lib folder - Good if you have relatively small amount of jars and few PU instances within the same GSC. These will be copied automatically by GigaSpaces during the deploy process to the `\gigaspaces-xap-premium\work` folder on all the machines running GSCs hosting the PU instances. You may control this folder location using the `com.gs.work` system property.
- Within the `\gigaspaces-xap-premium\lib\optional\pu-common` folder for each machine running GSCs - Each PU instance will have its own instance of the loaded class. Speed up the deployed time. You may control this folder location using the `com.gs.pu-common` system property.
- Within the `\gigaspaces-xap-premium\lib\platform\ext` folder for each machine running GSCs - All PUs class loaders will share the same loaded class. Speed up the deployed time. Optimize the JVM perm gem space usage since all 3rd party jars are loaded only once. You may control this folder location using the `com.gigaspaces.lib.platform.ext` system property.

Property files and other resources should be jared and placed within any of the above locations.

{{%accord title="Example"%}}

The following deploys a processing unit jar file named `data-processor.jar` using the `sync_replicated` cluster schema with 2 instances (`total_members`).

```bash
gs> deploy -cluster schema=sync_replicated total_members=2 data-processor.jar
```

The following deploys a processing unit archive called `data-processor.jar` using deployment properties file called `pu.properties`.


```bash
gs> deploy -properties file://config/pu.properties data-processor.jar

```

The following deploys a processing unit archive called `data-processor.jar` direct injecting the properties.


```bash
gs> deploy -properties embed://DB_username=postgres;DB_password=pass mirror
```

Using the following pu configuration:

```xml
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="org.postgresql.Driver"/>
    <property name="url" value="jdbc:postgresql:presence"/>
    <property name="username" value="${DB_username}"/>
    <property name="password" value="${DB_password}"/>
</bean>

```

The following deploys a processing unit archive called `data-processor.jar` using an SLA element read from an external `sla.xml` file.

```bash
gs> deploy -sla file://config/sla.xml data-processor.jar
```

The following example deploys a `partitioned` space cluster with the name `mySpace` for both the processing unit and the Space it contains.


```bash
deploy -cluster schema=partitioned total_members=2,1 -override-name mySpace -properties embed://dataGridName=mySpace myPUFolder
```



{{% tip %}}
Multiple deployment properties can be injected by having ; between each property - see below example:


```bash
>gs deploy -cluster schema=partitioned total_members=10,1
-properties "embed://dataGridName=myIMDG;space-config.proxy.router.active-server-lookup-timeout=5000;space-config.engine.max_threads=256;mypropA=aaa;mypropB=bbb" -override-name myPU /tmp/myPu.jar

{{%refer%}}
The [XAP Hot Deploy](/sbp/xap-hot-deploy.html) tool allows business logic running as a PU to be refreshed (rolling PU upgrade) without any system downtime and data loss. The tool uses the hot deploy approach , placing new PU code on the GSM PU deploy folder and later restart each PU instance.
