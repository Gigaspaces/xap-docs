        <h2>User Roles</h2>
        <p>InsightEdge Ops Manager provides advanced capabilities of services monitoring, data analysis, and connectivity to multiple data sources. These capabilities are divided into a list of screens and features with permissions for logging user roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Admin</b> (superuser) – has access to all capabilities including features related to services orchestration that has high impact on the environment resources consumption (e.g. scale up/down of service partitions).</li>
            <li><b>Engineer</b> – can deploy one or many services and connect with client applications and other components such as databases, ETL’s etc. An Engineer will deploy services, will test them – function and performance - and analyze the data behavior within the Space.</li>
            <li><b>Viewer</b> – data expert with a goal to optimize system behavior/performance. Responsible for defining the distribution rules of data in partitions, monitoring and analyzing applications' read performance, checking for resource bottlenecks, analyzing the sizes of data entities, including indexes and the efficiency of indexes over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Roles and Permissions in Ops Manager</h2>
        <p>The following table lists the various functionalities available in Ops Manager, based on the user's assigned role.</p>
