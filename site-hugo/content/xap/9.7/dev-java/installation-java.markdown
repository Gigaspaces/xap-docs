GigaSpaces XAP is 100% pure Java, and therefore can run on any UNIX or Windows machine that supports Java.

# Prior to Installation

**Prior to the GigaSpaces installation, make sure**:

- Review the release notes for the [supported platforms](/release_notes).
- [JDK](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp) (6 or later) is installed (for example, **JDK 6 Update 39**) 
- Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the JDK (not JRE) directory (for example, `D:\java\jdk1.6.0_39`).
- Set the `PATH` environment variable to include `JAVA_HOME\bin` (for example, `%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%`
- Optional: The network and machines running GigaSpaces are configured to enable multicast (see the [Multicast Configuration]({{%currentadmurl%}}/network-multicast.html) for more information).
- Set the `NIC_ADDR` environment variable to the machine's IP address.

{{%note%}}
Using JRE instead of JDKIt is recommended to use a JDK (Java Development Kit), and not a JRE (Java Runtime Environment). If you do decide to use a JRE, make sure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the correct JRE directory, and remove JDK-specific command-line arguments, like `-server`, which do not exist in JRE.

# Installing on Windows

gshome-directory
Unzip the ZIP file using your favorite unzip tool (e.g., WinZip) to the location of your choice. Unzipping the file creates a `<GigaSpaces Root>` directory e.g. {{%version "gshome-directory"%}} with the following files and folders:

**What's Next?**

- To verify a local installation, a remote installation, and the cluster configuration, refer to the [Testing System Environment]({{%currentadmurl%}}/troubleshooting-testing-system-environment.html) section.
- See the [Quick Start Guide](./tutorials.html) for your first steps with GigaSpaces.


# Installing on Linux

Step 1. Navigate into the directory where you want to install GigaSpaces XAP, e.g. `opt`, and execute an `unzip` command using the path to the GigaSpaces zip file. For example:


```java
build-filename
unzip {{%version "build-filename"%}}
```

Step 2. Make sure all `sh` file(s) in the `/bin` and the `/examples` directory are in executable mode, meaning you can run them from your machine. To check this, use the `ls \-all` command for the relevant directory, and make sure that `x` is included in the file permissions.

Step 3. Make sure all the machines running GigaSpaces can ping each other and their hosts file include the machine IP.

# Important Tips

Before you begin working with GigaSpaces, it is recommended to review the [Performance Tuning and Considerations]({{%currentadmurl%}}/tuning.html) sections and apply the required changes. For example, you may need to update the [**max file descriptors limit**]({{%currentadmurl%}}/tuning-infrastructure.html#Max Processes and File Descriptors Limit) before you begin.
