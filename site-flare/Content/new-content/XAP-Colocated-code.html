Instead, they specify what changes they want to make and for which objects using SQLQuery. These changes are then carried out within the JVM that stores the data. There are standard ways to make changes, like increasing a value 'increment' or setting a new one 'set value' or a property. You can also write custom code to define specific changes. This custom code can be updated while the program is running as it supports versioning.

The request is automatically sent to each data node that performs the aggregation and the results are sent to the client. The client then retrieves the results from all nodes and reduces them to provide the required answer. This API can handle common types of combining data, like sum, average, min and max.  Plus, you can even write your own way of combining data if you want. It's flexible too, supporting different versions of code running at the same time and letting you change the code without causing any downtime.
