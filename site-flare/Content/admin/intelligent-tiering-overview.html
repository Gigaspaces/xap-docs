        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Tiered Storage Overview</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">Tiered Storage provides seamless tiering of data between different storage tiers, to balance performance and storage media costs.</p>
        <p>The goal of Tiered Storage is to offer a cost-effective solution for storing large amounts of data while balancing cost with read/write performance. Data is divided into two logical layers or 'tiers'. By abstracting the complexity of tiered storage management, developers can focus on building and optimizing their applications without concern for the specifics of data placement and performance tuning.</p>
        <h1>Feature Overview</h1>
        <p>Data can be stored in two tiers. By strategically dividing data between these two tiers, Tiered Storage optimizes both performance and cost, ensuring that critical data operations are executed efficiently while maintaining overall storage expenses at a manageable level.</p>

        <ul MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">
            <li>
                <p><b>Hot Tier</b> <b>— RAM</b>: Priority data, used for read/write operations and analysis requiring fastest access</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Warm Tier — SSD</b> (recommended media): Additional data used mostly for read-only, analytical purposes</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typically, the Warm Tier contains all the data, while the Hot Tier holds a subset based on user-defined rules. The Warm Tier also acts as the persistence layer for all data.  The distribution of data across these tiers is handled based on predefined rules and is seamless to client applications. Applications access data in both tiers via standard APIs, without needing to be aware of the tiered structure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Data Distribution</b>: The system transparently manages the placement of data between the Hot and Warm Tiers based on predefined rules. This ensures that the most critical data is readily accessible in the Hot Tier, while the full dataset remains stored in the Warm Tier.</p>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Seamless Integration</b>: Client applications interact with the data storage system using standard APIs. This abstraction means that applications do not need to be aware of the underlying tiered storage architecture. Whether data resides in RAM or on disk, the access and manipulation of data remain consistent and straightforward from the application's perspective.</p>

        <h1>Architectural Overview</h1>
        <p>In Tiered Storage, space data partitioning adheres to the standard methodology. Space objects and documents are routed to partitions based on the routing key property value. Partitions not only manage data in RAM but also on disk volumes. Consequently, within a Space partition, an object can reside in RAM, on disk, or in both locations. This dual-layered storage approach ensures efficient data management and access within each partition.</p>

        <h2>Kubernetes Environments</h2>
        <p>Tiered Storage implementation in Kubernetes involves managing disk volumes using standard resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>StorageClass</b>: A cluster-level resource abstracting the storage provisioner in a given environment. This resource must be created by an administrator before deploying a space with Tiered Storage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>StatefulSet</b>: Represents a space, ensuring a fixed relation between space partition pods and disk volumes. Created by running the space helm install command.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)</b>: Represents a disk volume attached to a partition. PVCs (one per space partition) are created automatically by the space helm install command.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Optimizing the Use of Tiered Storage</h1>
        <p>In order to get the most out of Tiered Storage, please note the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <li>
                    <p>By analyzing the query criteria, if it is definitely seen that all data is in the Hot layer, only the cache will be queried.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If max entries for the read is specified and there are max entries in cache that meets the query condition, only cache will be queried. If there is no limit, the query will go to the disk.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Using read API - ReadModifier : MEMORY_ONLY_SEARCH</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When running using jdbc init the connection with properties. add readModifiers property with MEMORY_ONLY_SEARCH value.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Using the above modifier the number of objects in cache/total are revealed via the API.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The metrics are reported by <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> and can be viewed using a reporting tool such a Grafana.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>According to the query criteria versus the Hot tier criteria, queries use the Hot tier only if all of the required data is present in the Hot tier. You can modify the <a href="../dev-java/transaction-read-modifiers.html">read modifier</a> to allow memory search only or the number of objects to read can be limited and they can be found in the Hot tier.</p>
