        <h1>FIFO Grouping</h1>
        <p>The FIFO grouping feature is designed to allow for efficient processing of events with partial ordering constraints. To better understand FIFO groups, let's first examine the constraints of total ordering, i.e. What it takes to process events in the exact order in which they arrive. There are two elements that effectively limit the scalability of processing events with total ordering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining the original order of arrival (the "natural FIFO order"), which requires the Space to maintain a central data structure (i.e. event queue) that is accessed every time an event enters the system. This can become a central bottleneck quite quickly and limit the throughput of the system.</li>
            <li>Ensuring in-order processing of events. This seems quite straight forward once you maintain the natural FIFO ordering, but in many cases, you want to ensure that a certain event will not be processed until its preceding event has been fully processed. This requirement effectively means that you can only process one event at a time, constraining the event processing to a single thread.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In most cases, your application does not require total ordering, but rather ordering within groups of events. Let's take a flight booking system as an example. Such an system should process the bookings for each flight one by one, to avoid conflicting bookings for the same seats and ensure fairness, but it can process many flights simultaneously, since there's no relevance to the order of processing across different flights. The FIFO groups feature allows you to implement this kind of scenario easily by designating a "FIFO group" field. The value of this field indicates the unique group identifier. In the above example, this would be the flight number, so effectively your application can process many bookings simultaneously for different flights, but it will never process two bookings for the same flight simultaneously. In more generic terms, the FIFO groups capability ensures the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Within the same group, events will be processed in the order they arrived, and exclusively, meaning that only one event will be processed at a time, regardless of the number of event processors.</li>
            <li>Across groups, any number of events can be processed simultaneously.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tc-align-center">

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>FIFO-Grouping can be used with financial systems to process <span class="tc-bold">trade orders</span> , in healthcare systems to processes <span class="tc-bold">patient medical data</span> , with transportation systems to process <span class="tc-bold">reservations</span> , with airlines systems to process <span class="tc-bold">flight schedule</span> , with billing system to processes <span class="tc-bold">payments</span>, etc. With the flight reservation system scenario several reservations can be processed simultaneously but the reservations of a particular fight must be processed exclusively and in FIFO order.</p>
        <h1><a name="how-it-works"></a>How it works</h1>
        <p>FIFO-Grouping ("FG') enables reading/taking certain space entries in FIFO order (by order of insertion), and is mainly used as an enhancement of the openspaces polling-containers.  When a property is declared with the <code>SpaceFifoGroupingProperty</code> attribute ("the FG designated property'), a read/take operation with the <code>FIFO_GROUPING_POLL</code> modifier will return all space entries that match the selection template in FIFO order. Different values of the FG property define groups of space entries that match that value - FIFO ordering exists within each group and not between different groups.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>The selected group is locked until the operation is terminated- the operation transaction is committed/ aborted.  See the <a href="fifo-grouping.html#exclusivity">Exclusivity</a> section for more information.</p>
        </div>
        <h1><a name="method-of-operation"></a>Method Of Operation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>FG operations must be performed within transactions.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Any class that supports FG is logically divided to groups according to the FG designated property.
This property must be indexed and will be automatically indexed by the system if an index definition does not exist for it.  An additional data structure is kept for this property in order to assist in traversing the different groups.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the selecting template a null value will generally be rendered for this property which stands for bring any available group.
An available group is any FG that matches the selection template and is not currently locked by another FG thread (see <a href="fifo-grouping.html#exclusivity">Exclusivity</a> section).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the selecting template (Pojo) has a value for a property other than the FG designated property - this property can be indexed (like for any regular read/take operation) and in addition a <code>SpaceFifoGroupingIndex</code> attribute can be added  to it  in order to assist in efficient traversal.
In this case the system will create a compound index that contains this property and the FG designated property.
For example, if a polling container is responsible for all the new reservations (reservations with processingState = NEW), then it is recommended to declare a <code>SpaceFifoGroupingIndex</code> on the processingState property.
This would help to achieve better performance when searching for reservations of certain flight that have processingState = NEW.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p><code>SpaceFifoGroupingIndex</code> affects the size of the footprint.</p>
        </div>
        <h1><a name="exclusivity"></a>Exclusivity</h1>
        <p>Once a FG operation returns with a result, the relevant group(s) is locked to other FG threads until the transaction is terminated. The locked group is the group with the value returned in the FG designated property and matching the selecting template.
<span class="tc-bold">The exclusivity rule is as follows:</span>
A group can be locked by a requesting template if no other template is locking the same FG designated property value, or - if another template is locking the same FG designated property value, the intersection between the 2 groups is null.</p>
        <p><span class="tc-bold">For example:</span>
Lets assume we have an Order POJO template with property named label marked with  <code>SpaceFifoGroupingProperty</code> attribute and property named state marked with  <code>SpaceFifoGroupingIndex</code> attribute .
If polling container A got a FG with Label = "LABEL1" using an Order POJO with State property = null, no other FG thread/container will be able to access the FG designated by "LABEL1".
If on the other hand polling container B got a FG with Label = "LABEL2" using an Order pojo with State property = 0, polling container C will be able to get FG with same label "LABEL2" using an Order pojo with State = 1, since the intersection between the groups is null. Exclusivity is released upon transaction termination.</p>
        <h1><a name="interaction-with-non-fifo-grouping-templates"></a>Interaction with non-FIFO Grouping Templates</h1>
        <p>When a FG template locks a group, its first entry is locked under a transaction so it cannot be accessed by any destructive space operation. The other entries in the group are not physically locked and may be operated-upon by non FG templates. If a FG template which is intending to lock a group encounters its first entry locked under a transaction by a non FG template - this group is abandoned in order not to create a gap (by skipping the first entry)</p>
