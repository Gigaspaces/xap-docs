        <h1>Administration API</h1>
        <p>The Service Grid Admin API provides a way to administer and monitor all of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> services and components, using a simple API. The Admin API provides information and the ability to operate on the currently running Service Grid Agents, Service Grid Managers, Service Grid Containers, Lookup Services, Processing Units, and Spaces.</p>
        <p>The following code examples show how the Admin API can be used to display information on the currently deployed services/components:</p>

        <h1><a name="admin-construction"></a>Admin Construction</h1>
        <p>Use <code>ServiceGridAdminBuilder</code> to create <code>IServiceGridAdmin</code> instances. After working with the <code>IServiceGridAdmin</code> is done, its <code>IServiceGridAdmin.Dispose()</code> method should be called.</p>
        <p>The Admin API discovers all the advertised services from the Lookup Services. In order to define which lookup groups are used, the <code>ServiceGridAdminBuilder.Groups.Add</code> can be used. The lookup locators can also be used for a non-multicast-enabled environment, using <code>ServiceGridAdminBuilder.Locators.Add</code>. If the services started are secured, the username and password can also be set in the Admin API.</p>
        <h1><a name="discovery-process"></a>Discovery Process</h1>
        <p>When the <code>IServiceGridAdmin</code> is created, it starts to receive discovery events of all the advertised services/components within its lookup groups/lookup locators. The events occur asynchronously, and the data model within the Admin API gets initialized in the background with services coming and going.</p>
        <p>This means that just creating the <code>IServiceGridAdmin</code>, and calling a specific get property for a data structure, might not return what is currently deployed, and you should wait until the structures are filled. Some components have a <code>WaitFor</code> method that allows them to wait for a specific number of services to be up. When navigating the data model, the Admin API provides the most up-to-date state of the system that it is monitoring.</p>
        <h1><a name="domain-model"></a>Domain Model</h1>
        <p>The Service Grid Admin Domain Model has representation to the main actors at different <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> levels. They include:</p>

        <h1><a name="accessing-the-domain-model"></a>Accessing the Domain Model</h1>
        <p>There are two ways the Service Grid Admin API can be used to access information the Admin API can provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Call specific properties for the data, and enumerate over them (as shown in the example at the top of the page).</li>
            <li>Register for specific events using the Service Grid Admin API. Events are handled by different components of the Admin API in similar manner. We will take one of them and use it as a reference example.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we want to register, for example, for Grid Service Container additions, we can use the following code (removing the event listener is not shown here for clarity):</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">admin.GridServiceContainers.GridServiceContainerAdded += HandleGridServiceContainerAdded;

private void HandleGridServiceContainerAdded(object sender, GridServiceContainerEventArgs e)
{
    IGridServiceContainer gsc = e.GridServiceContainer;
    // do something here
}
</code></pre>
        <p>Removals are done in a similar manner:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">admin.GridServiceContainers.GridServiceContainerRemoved += HandleGridServiceContainerRemoved;

void HandleGridServiceContainerRemoved(object sender, GridServiceContainerEventArgs e)
{
    IGridServiceContainer gsc = e.GridServiceContainer;
    // do something here
}
</code></pre>
        <p>All other data structures use a similar API to register for events. Some might have specific events that go beyond just additions and removals, but they still use the same model. For example, the following example shows how to register for Space mode change events across all currently running Space topologies and Space instances:</p><pre><code class="language-csharp">admin.Spaces.SpaceModeChanged += HandleSpaceModeChanged;

void Spaces_SpaceModeChanged(object sender, SpaceModeChangedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Space [" + e.SpaceInstance.Space.Name + "] " +
                "Instance [" + e.SpaceInstance.InstanceId + "/" + e.SpaceInstance.BackupId + "] " +
                "changed mode from [" + e.PreviousMode + "] to [" + e.NewMode + "]");

}
</code></pre>
        <p>Of course, we can register the same event listener on a specific <code>ISpace</code> topology, or event on a specific <code>ISpaceInstance</code>.</p>
        <h1><a name="details-and-statistics"></a>Details and Statistics</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Some components in the Admin API can provide statistics. For example, an <code>ISpaceInstance</code> can provide statistics on how many times the read API was called on it. Statistics change over time, and in order to get them, either the property for the statistics can be used, or a statistics listener can be registered for statistics change events.</li>
            <li>Details of a specific component provide information that does not change over time, but can be used to provide more information regarding the component, or to compute statistics. For example, the <code>IVirtualMachine</code> provides in its details, the minimum and maximum heap memory size, from which the <code>IVirtualMachine</code> statistics provide the currently used heap memory size. The detailed information is used to provide the percentage used in the Virtual Machine statistics.</li>
            <li>The Admin API also provides aggregated details and statistics. For example, <code>ISpace</code> provides <code>ISpaceStatistics</code>, allowing you to get the aggregated statistics of all the different Space instances that belong to it.</li>
            <li>Each component in the Admin API that can provide statistics (either direct or aggregated statistics) implements the <code>IStatisticsMonitor</code> interface. The statistics monitor allows you to start or stop monitoring statistics. Monitoring for statistics is required to register for statistics change events. The interval at which statistics are polled is controlled using the statistics interval.</li>
            <li>The statistics interval is an important event when the Admin API is not actively polling for statistics. Each call to a property of statistics only performs a remote call to the component, if the last statistics fetch happened <span class="tc-bold">before</span> the statistics interval. This behavior means that users of the Admin API do not have to worry about "hammering" different components for statistics, because the Admin API makes sure that statistics calls are cached internally for the statistics interval period.</li>
            <li>An <code>ISpaceInstance</code> implements the <code>IStatisticsMonitor</code> interface. Calling <code>StartMonitor</code> and <code>StopMonitor</code> on it causes monitoring of statistics to be enabled or disabled on it.</li>
            <li><code>ISpace</code> also implements the <code>IStatisticsMonitor</code> interface. Calling <code>StartMonitor</code> on it causes it to start monitoring all its <code>ISpaceInstance</code>s. If an <code>ISpaceInstance</code> is discovered after the the call to <code>startMonitor</code> occurs, it starts monitoring itself automatically. This means that if the <code>SpaceInstanceStatistics</code> event was registered on the <code>ISpace</code>, it automatically starts to get Space instance statistics change events for the newly discovered <code>ISpaceInstance</code>.</li>
            <li><code>ISpaces</code> also implements the <code>IStatisticsMonitor</code> interface. Calling <code>StartMonitor</code> on it causes it to start monitoring all the <code>ISpace</code>s it has (and as a result, also <code>ISpaceInstance</code>s, - see the paragraph above). A <code>SpaceInstanceStatistics</code> can also be registered on the <code>ISpaces</code> level.</li>
            <li>The above Space level statistics behavior works in much the same way with other components. For example, <code>IVirutalMachine</code> and <code>IVirtualMachines</code>, <code>ITransport</code> and <code>ITransports</code>, <code>IOperatingSystem</code> and <code>OperatingSystems</code>.</li>
            <li>The <code>IServiceGridAdmin</code> interface also implements the <code>IStatisticsMonitor</code> interface. Calling <code>StartMonitor</code> on it causes all holders to start monitoring. These include <code>ISpaces</code>, <code>IVirtualMachines</code>, <code>ITransports</code>, and <code>IOperatingSystems</code>.</li>
        </ul>
