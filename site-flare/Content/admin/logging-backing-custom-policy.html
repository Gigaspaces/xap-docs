        <h1>Backing Up Files With a Custom Policy</h1>
        <p>A backup policy can be configured to back up files. By default a <code>NullBackupPolicy</code> is configured, which does nothing. It can be replaced by a <code>DeleteBackupPolicy</code> to keep a backup of files for a specified period of time. The <code>BackupPolicy</code> interface allows custom implementations to be plugged-in.</p>
        <h1><a name="null-backup-policy"></a>Null Backup Policy</h1>
        <p>A null backup policy acts as a placeholder for a "do-nothing' behavior. Used when an exception occurs trying to instantiate a customized backup policy, or if no policy is desired.</p>
        <h1><a name="delete-backup-policy"></a>Delete Backup Policy</h1>
        <p>A backup policy that deletes any file that is older than the specified backup period, but keeps at least as many of the specified backup files.</p>
        <p>By default, a file is kept for a 30-day period. After 30 days, the file is deleted, unless there are less than 10 backup files available. In other words, maintain a history of 10 files, even if there was nothing logged for more than 30 days.</p>
        <p>These properties can be configured by modifying the logging configuration file:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">com.gigaspaces.logger.RollingFileHandler.backup-policy = com.gigaspaces.logger.DeleteBackupPolicy
com.gigaspaces.logger.DeleteBackupPolicy.period = 30
com.gigaspaces.logger.DeleteBackupPolicy.backup = 10
</code></pre>
        <p>The backup properties can also be configured using a system property override:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">-Dcom.gigaspaces.logger.DeleteBackupPolicy.[property-name]=[property-value]

For example:
-Dcom.gigaspaces.logger.DeleteBackupPolicy.period=30
</code></pre>
        <h1><a name="customized-backup-policy"></a>Customized Backup Policy</h1>
        <p>The <code>com.gigaspaces.logger.</code><code>BackupPolicy</code> is an interface for a pluggable backup policy. For example, you may wish to write an implementation to zip files if a certain threshold is reached. The interface has a single method, which is used to <span class="tc-bold">track</span> newly created log files. A file is either created upon rollover or at initialization time. Implementation can keep track of files and decide whether to trigger the backup policy.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">    public void track(File file);
</code></pre>
