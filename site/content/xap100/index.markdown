[Installation](./installation.html){{<wbr>}}
This guide provides step by step instructions on how to download and install XAP on different operating systems for the supported languages.

[Getting started](./tutorials.html){{<wbr>}}
Here you will find a quick start guide that explains how to deploy and use a GigaSpace XAP Data Grid. A full Java tutorial is also provided that will introduce you to the basic capabilities and features of the XAP platform.

[XAP API](./programmers-guide.html){{<wbr>}}
The guide provides all the information and tools needed to quickly develop either basic or more complex scaled-out applications

[The Processing Unit](./the-processing-unit-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
The Processing Unit is the unit of packaging and deployment in the GigaSpaces XAP platform. This section describes its directory structure, deployment descriptor and SLA definition and configuration.

[Elastic Processing Unit](./elastic-processing-unit-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
How to deploy and manage an Elastic Processing Unit (EPU).

[Web Application Support](./web-application-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
XAP's integration with the Service Grid allows you to deploy web applications (packaged as a WAR file) onto the Service Grid.

[Space Replication](./multi-space-replication-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
Multiple space replication is the ability to replicate state between different deployed spaces, i.e different cluster of space instances.

[Multi Site Replication](./multi-site-replication-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
Multiple site replication is the ability to replicate state between different deployed spaces, where each space can be also physically located in a different geographical location (also termed a different deployment site).

[Platform Interoperability](./interoperability-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
The possibility for organizations whose projects include a combination of Java, .NET and C++ platforms to communicate and access each other easily and efficiently while also maintaining the benefits of the XAP scale-out application server.
