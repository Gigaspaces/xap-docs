This tutorial explains how the sample Spring PetClinic application can be fine tuned to use GigaSpaces XAP [JPA API]({{%latestjavaurl%}}/jpa-api.html) and deployed into the GigaSpaces XAP platform.

Will show you how to:

- Adjust the PetClinic domain model to use the distributed XAP JPA implementation. <br>
- Utilize scalable distributed patterns such as partitioning, colocation of data and business logic and Map/Reduce to scale your JPA application.  <br>
- Deploy the application on to the XAP runtime environment to achieve high availability and self healing capabilities.  <br>
