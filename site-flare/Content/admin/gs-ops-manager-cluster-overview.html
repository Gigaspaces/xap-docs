        <h2>Cluster Metrics</h2>
        <p>Ops Manager includes graphs that display the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CPU&#160;usage - view the average CPU utilization as a percentage. This metric is available at the cluster level, and at the service level.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">Memory usage - view the actual RAM usage, along with secondary storage tier (off-heap ) usage.</li>
            <li>IOPS - View the implemented IOPS types (such as reads, writes, takes, executes, etc. per second at the cluster level, and at the service level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ops Manager metrics can be ported to InfluxDB or other time series databases, so that you can use external monitoring and visualization tools (such as Grafana) to perform additional analysis.</p>
        <h2>Service Overview</h2>
        <p>The service overview shows a summary of all services vs. unhealthy services. You can also view the services sorted by health and severity. Additionally, you can apply filters by service type and RAM&#160;utilization, or search for specific services by name. Click a service to drill through to see the individual performance metrics and alerts for that service. For deeper analysis, you can create a dump file of the service logs via the download button in the upper right-hand corner.</p>
        <p>In addition to reviewing the performance of individual services, you can drill down to the partition and instance level to review metrics such as CPU&#160;usage and memory consumption per specific instance.</p>
