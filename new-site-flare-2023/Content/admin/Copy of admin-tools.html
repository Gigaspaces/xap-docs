<h1>Administration Tools</h1>
  <p>GigaSpaces offers several administration tools that can be used to manage <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />-based or <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />-based applications that have been built on top of a licensed edition. Some tools are more useful during the initial investigation and development stages when exploring the capabilities of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />, while other tools are effective for configuring and administering advanced development and production environments.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="tools-cli.html">Command Line Interface</a> has several commands that can be used in an open-source environment. It also has administration commands for licensed editions that are based on the REST Manager API, along with means for automation using non-interactive mode.</li>
<li>The <a href="admin-rest-manager-api.html">REST Manager API</a> supports administration of both the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> service grid and IngightEdge via Apache Spark, and can also be extended to support custom options.</li>
<li>The <a href="tools-web-ui.html">Web Management Console</a> provides a light, web-based user interface for administration of Space and Processing Unit components in the service grid.</li>
<li>The <a href="tools-desktop-ui.html">GigaSpaces Management Center</a> provides a visual user interface for managing users and roles in the system, along with comprehensive administration capabilities.</li>
<li>The <a href="admin-administration-api.html">Administration API</a> supports top-level management and monitoring of all <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> components.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can opt to perform administration and maintenance via any of the above tools, based on the needs of your environment and the actions supported per tool.</p>
