The unified InsightEdge solution, a combination of the XAP in-memory data grid and an open-source analytics ecosystem, is an in-memory insight platform that supports fast-data analytics, artificial intelligence and real-time applications. Customers can use this platform to develop their own systems that provide instant data-driven insights with time-to-analytics at a sub-second scale, and the ability to hyperscale analytics from SQL, streaming to machine learning via Apache Spark.

The InsightEdge Platform provides extreme performance with ultra-low latency, high-throughput transactions and stream processing, due to the co-location of applications and analytics. All of this functionality is available in a cloud-native, infrastructure-agnostic deployment for hybrid cloud and on-premises environments. 

The full InsightEdge Platform offers the following additional benefits:

* Multi-tiered data storage across RAM, SSD, and Storage-Class Memory (3DXPoint) 

* High availability (up to 5 nines) with auto-healing

* Disaster recovery via geo-redundancy, fast data replication and native persistence
