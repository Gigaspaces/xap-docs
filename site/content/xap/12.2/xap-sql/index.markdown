Traditionally, customers adopting our platform come from a database (SQL) background. In order to give them a familiar interface for looking into what data exists in the grid, we created a SQL adapter that lets them query the grid as if it's a traditional database. This gives the opportunity to, now, plug-in existing visualization tools (like Tableau, MicroStrategy, QlikView) 
directly into the grid and use a drag and drop interface to look into grid data.
