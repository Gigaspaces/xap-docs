        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Deploy and Undeploy Services in Ops Manager</h1>
        <p>Ops Manager can be used to deploy and undeploy a service.</p>
        <h1>Deploy Command in Ops Manager</h1>
        <p>With the deploy command, a business user can introduce new services to the grid. These can be either stateful services including a Space and data, or stateless services with business logic.</p>
        <p>On the Services screen, click on the deploy option (plus sign) to introduce a new service to the grid:</p>

        </p>
        <p>Then we see the Deploy Service screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/OPM-deploy-service-dialog-box.jpg" class="tc-picture70" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Service name</b> - The name of the new service that will be introduced to the grid </li>
            <li><b>Resource</b> - Location of the Java jar file for the service. Can be in a local file, or point to a URL.</li>
            <li><b>Properties</b> - Freestyle, name and value. Click on <b>+</b> to add a property and value, delete <span class="tc-highlight">(or minus sign?)</span> to remove.<br />The defined properties and their values are used as part of the deploy process for various configuration purposes.</li>
            <li><b>Topology</b> - Click on the Topology dropdown to choose the service type:<br /><img src="../Resources/Static/images/OPM-deploy-service-topology-dropdown.jpg" class="tc-picture50" /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you click on <b>stateful</b>, you see the following screen. Note that for a stateful service, you will be able to review a list of properties.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">Note for RAM units -- It's not clear right now if Kubernetes will be supported in GA. If it is supported, then the RAM units for Kubernetes environment should automatically show as MiB (Mebibytes), not MB.</p>
        <p>If in the previous screen you click on <b>stateless</b>, you see this screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/OPM-deploy-service-topology-stateless.jpg" class="tc-picture50" />
        </p>
        <p>In this screen, choose the resources that you wish to make available for the service. Note that there is no High availability for a stateless service.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>After you click <b>Apply</b>, a message appears in the screen banner, indicating that the service deployment is in progress:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/OPM-deploy-service-in-progress.jpg" class="tc-picture90" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When the service deployment is completed, a message indicating this fact appears in the screen banner.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/OPM-deploy-service-completed.jpg" class="tc-picture90" />
        </p>
        <h1>Undeploy Command in Ops Manager</h1>
        <p>On the Service screen for the service you wish to undeploy, Overview screen, click on <b>Undeploy</b> to undeploy the service.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/OPM-deploy-service-undeploy-command.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>After you click on Undeploy, the system will ask for confirmation, then it will undeploy the service.</p>
