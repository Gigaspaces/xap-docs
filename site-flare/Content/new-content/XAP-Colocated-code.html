                        <td align="left">When client applications want to change the Space data, there is no need to bring the data into the client and trigger an update. Instead, the client application describes what it wants to change for which objects (supplying SQLQuery), and the operation is performed in the JVM which holds that data. There are default change possibilities such as ‘increment’ or ‘set value’ of a property. There is also customized change code that describes how the change should be done. Custom code supports versioning so the code itself can be changed in runtime.

This means that information is gathered from all partitions and some action is performed on it from the client side. For example, if you have a sum to perform, you perform it in each partition and then return the results to the client.  The client retrieves the sum from each place and concatenates all the sums to return the final sum result. Parallel different versions of the code are supported.

At the client, the results from all nodes are reduced to the required answer. Includes support for default common aggregations as sum, average, min, max etc, and in addition allow custom aggregation to be written. Support for parallel code version and changing code with no downtime.
