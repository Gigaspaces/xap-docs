<h1>Scala</h1>
  <p>GigaSpaces offer several extensions to the XAP API, to more easily combine Scala with XAP. This includes support for <a href="scala-constructor-based-properties.htm">constructor-based properties</a>, a wrapper around the XAP API for <a href="scala-task-execution.htm">task execution</a>, <a href="scala-predicate-based-queries.htm">predicate-based queries</a>, and a <a href="scala-scripting-executor.htm">scripting executor</a> (part of the <a href="task-dynamic-language.htm">Dynamic Language Tasks</a> feature).</p>

<p>This section also provides an <a href="scala-enhanced-repl.htm">enhanced REPL</a> demo of what can be done with the XAP scala shell, along with a <a href="scala-exemplary-project.htm">sample project</a> that shows how XAP Scala can be used in a real project, and how Scala and Java code can be integrated.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>The minimum Scala version supported by the Scala XAP extension is [%=Versions.scala%].</p>
</div>

<p>Assuming there is a scala installation under <code>$SCALA_HOME</code>, the jars under <code>$SCALA_HOME/lib</code> should be copied to <code>$GS_HOME/lib/optional/scala/lib</code>.</p>
