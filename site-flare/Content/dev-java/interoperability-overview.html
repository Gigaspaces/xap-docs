        <h1>Platform Interoperability</h1>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Some of the features listed on this page are not part of the open-source edition, and are only available in the licensed editions (starting with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAPPrem" />).</p>
        </div>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> supports interoperability, which is the ability for organizations whose projects include a combination of Java, .NET and other platforms to communicate and access each other easily and efficiently, while also maintaining the benefits of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> scale-out application server:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="tc-bold">Transparency</span>: Use your native API in the Space transparently with minimum changes to existing assets. Objects are stored in the Space in the same manner regardless of the platform they are written from. For example, an object can be written to the space from a Java service, and a .NET service can receive the notification.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="tc-bold">Performance</span>: Communicate between platforms directly through the Space, without the need for adapters or XML translation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="tc-bold">SOA</span>: All applications communicate using the Space, allowing each of them to exist as a loosely-coupled service.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>To work with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> interoperability, classes from the different platforms should meet the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="tc-bold">same fully qualified name</span> (i.e. including package/namespace).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="tc-bold">same hierarchy</span> (i.e. same base/superclass structure).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="tc-bold">same properties with the same names and matching types</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
