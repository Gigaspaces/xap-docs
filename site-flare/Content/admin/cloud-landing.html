        <ul>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">ElastiGrid</span> - orchestration option for cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environments that provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of virtualized and containerized applications.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">gsctl</span> - a standalone CLI tool that you can use to create, provision, and install <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> clusters in the cloud or on premise.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">Ops Manager</span> - the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> native administration and monitoring tool, which is web based and runs automatically when <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> services are deployed.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">Monitoring stack</span> - based on InfluxDB, Grafana, and Telegraf for monitoring <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> cluster activity and metrics using dashboards</li>

## Using Apache Zeppelin with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />

Apache Zeppelin is a multi-purpose web notebook that supports data ingestion and discovery, as well as data analytics, visualization, and collaboration.

Apache Zeppelin contains a built-in Apache Spark integration. This provides the following:

- Automatic SparkContext and SQLContext injection
- Runtime JAR dependency loading from the local file system or Maven repository
- Ability to view job progress and cancel jobs 

The Zeppelin notebook packaged with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> includes several <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> demo applications, along with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />-specific settings that can be configured in the Spark interpreter in order to establish the connection between Spark and the data grid. 

KubeGrid runs Apache Zeppelin in a dedicated Pod, to enable ???
