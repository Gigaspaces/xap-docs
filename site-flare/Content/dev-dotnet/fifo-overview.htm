<h1>FIFO Ordering</h1>
  <p>Supporting FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior for Entries is a critical requirement when building messaging systems or implementing master-worker patterns. Users should be able to get Entries in the same order in which they were written. XAP supports both non-ordered Entries and FIFO-ordered Entries when performing Space operations.</p>
