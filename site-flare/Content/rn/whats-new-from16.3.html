        <p>GigaSpaces new User Interface<i><MadCap:xref href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-overview.html"><a href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-overview.html">SpaceDeck</a></MadCap:xref></i> is now fully available for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> users. </p>
        <p>SpaceDeck is an intuitive, streamlined user interface to manage and control the GigaSpaces environment.</p>
        <p>Using SpaceDeck, you can define the tools to bring legacy System of Record (SoR) databases into the in-memory data grid that is the core of the GigaSpaces system.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>&#160;For Smart DIH SpaceDeck does not yet cover all functionality. Our<MadCap:xref href="../admin/gs-ops-manager-overview.html"> Ops Manager</MadCap:xref> UI is still used to manage <a href="platform-access.html">certain functionality</a>. SpaceDeck is initially available for SmartDIH installations, and will be extended in future releases to eventually replace the older UIs. Smart Cache also uses <MadCap:xref href="../admin/tools-desktop-ui.html">GigaSpaces Management Center</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../admin/tools-web-ui.html">Web Management Console</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                <p>Introducing the <a href="../Data Integration/DI-Intro.html">Data Integration (DI)</a> layer, which is a vital part of the Digital Integration Hub (DIH) platform. DI is the gateway for incoming data into the Data Integration Hub (DIH) system. This is deployed via Kubernetes only. The DI components are delivered as part of the GigaSpaces DIH Package. DI contains four components which are responsible for reading and analyzing Kafka messages and for pushing them into the Space. DI is responsible for a wide range of data integration tasks as ingesting data in batches or streaming data changes. DI integrates with DB2 on AS/400, Oracle and MSSQL databases. It also contains the  IBM Infosphere Data Replication (IIDR) which is a connector engine for data pipelines.</p>
