{{% warning "Deprecation"%}}
The ZetaScale MemoryXtend add-on is deprecated and will not be released in future versions. If you're looking for an SSD-based MemoryXtend solution, refer to the [MemoryXtend RocksDB add-on](./memoryxtend-rocksdb-ssd.html). If you're already using ZetaScale and interested in switching to RocksDB, please contact [GigaSpaces Customer Support](http://www.gigaspaces.com/content/customer-support-services) for more information.
