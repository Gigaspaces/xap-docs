<h1>Viewing Clustered Space Status</h1>
  

<p>The status of clustered spaces can be viewed using different logging levels. This status is managed by two threads - a <code>Monitor</code> and a <code>Detector</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Monitor</code> monitors the status of live spaces and reports disconnections, while the <code>Detector</code> detects the status of disconnected spaces and reports reconnection. The space status frequency can be configured using the <code>CONFIG</code> logging level.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>See the <a href="tuning-proxy-connectivity.html">Proxy Connectivity</a> for details how to tune the Monitor and Detector behavior.</p>
</div>

<p>The <code>com.gigaspaces.client.cluster.liveness</code> logger is set by default (in <code>xap_logging.properties</code>) to <code>INFO</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">com.gigaspaces.client.cluster.liveness.level = INFO
</code></pre>

<p>The different logging levels are detailed below:</p>

<p>Logging granularity and information assists in tracing the availability of cluster members when using load-balancing or failover policies.</p>

<p>In most cases, <code>livenessDetectorFrequency</code> is the property you need to alter, since it is responsible for detecting spaces that are unavailable.</p>

<p>The unavailability of cluster members is noticed when a direct operation is performed on them. The <code>livenessMonitorFrequency</code> property timely monitors all live cluster members. Usually, when you have backup-only spaces, this is most important. The only time an operation is performed on a <span class="tc-italic">backup-only</span> space is when it becomes active (i.e., primary), and thus you want it's availability status to be noticed beforehand.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>It is recommended to <span class="tc-bold">increase the value of the <code>Monitor</code> thread to a maximum</span> if there are <span class="tc-bold">many clients</span> or if a large cluster is used.</p>
</div>

<p>Usually, when there is no <span class="tc-bold">failover</span> or when there are no <code>backup-only</code> spaces, the <code>Monitor</code> thread can be safely set to its maximum value, since clients directly interact with the space members. If either is detected as unavailable, the <code>Detector</code> thread is responsible for detecting whether they become available again.</p>
