[Installation](xapnet-installation.html)<br>
Learn how to download and install XAP.

[XAP.NET in 5 minutes](xapnet-in-5-minutes.html)<br>
This tutorial explains how to deploy and use a XAP [Data Grid](../overview/the-in-memory-data-grid.html) from a .NET client application.

[Interacting with the Space](xapnet-tutorial-part1.html)<br>
This tutorial demonstrates how to create a Space, and how to interact with it. It also demonstrates how to improve the Space search performance by using indexes and returning partial results.

[Deploying a Space](xapnet-tutorial-part2.html)<br>
The previous tutorial explained XAP's capabilities as a data store. This tutorial shows how to deploy an In Memory Data Grid (IMDG) that provides scalability and failover.

[Distributed Processing](xapnet-tutorial-part3.html)<br>
This tutorial introduces the different processing services that can run on top of the Space.

[Event-Driven Programming](xapnet-tutorial-part4.html)<br>
The Spaces Messaging and Events support provides messaging handlers that simplify event-driven programming.

[Creating a Processing Unit](xapnet-tutorial-part5.html)<br>
The Processing Unit is the fundamental unit of deployment in XAP. The Processing Unit itself runs within a Processing Unit Container, and is deployed onto the Service Grid. When a Processing Unit is deployed, a Processing Unit instance is the actual runtime entity.

[Transactions and Concurrency](xapnet-tutorial-part6.html)<br>
This tutorial introduces the transaction processing capabilities of XAP.

[Persist to Database](xapnet-tutorial-part7.html)<br>
There are many situations where Space data needs to be persisted to permanent storage and retrieved from it.
