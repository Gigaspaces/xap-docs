        <h1>Leader Election</h1>
        <h1><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h1>
        <p>This section describes the Space's leader election mechanism, which is based on the CAP theorem. It also explains how to configure and optimize it.</p>
        <h1><a name="cap-theorem"></a>CAP Theorem</h1>
        <p>The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), &#160;This is the default path.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Availability (node failures do not prevent survivors from continuing to operate). This is only applicable for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Partition Tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tc-align-center">

        <p>Gigaspaces provides two available implementations to support the approach that is best suited to your environment and business needs. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Version.16-3-born">Consistency based implementation is based on Apache Zookeeper, whereas availability based is based on the native Lookup Service.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Zookeeper is used to avoid split brain. This is because the instance that is disconnected from Zookeeper is suspended until it reconnects to Zookeeper. At this stage a decision is taken whether the instance can resume as primary or should become a backup.</p>
        </div>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> recommends that you use partition tolerance plus consistency. However, if your system does not include at least three machines, you can manually choose to work with partition tolerance plus availability. &#160;</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-important">
            <p>It is possible to start a cluster without using xap-manager and get the availability, but this means that you might risk <a href="leader-election-availability-biased.html">split brain</a>. If this option is required by your organization, please consult the <a href="mailto:support@gigaspaces.com">GigaSpaces support</a> team.</p>
