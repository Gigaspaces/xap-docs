<h1>Event Processing</h1>
  <p>This section the event processing APIs and how to configure them on top of the space. The relevant APIs include the <a href="notify-container-overview.html">Notify Container</a>, which wraps the Space data event session API with event container abstraction, and the <a href="polling-container-overview.html">Polling Container</a>, which allows you to perform polling receive operations against the Space.</p>

<p>The <a href="event-listener-container.html">Event Listener Container</a> is an interface that represents an abstraction for subscribing to, and receiving events over a Space proxy.</p>

<p>Regarding <a href="fifo-overview.html">FIFO Ordering</a>, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> supports both non-ordered Entries and FIFO ordered Entries when performing space operations.</p>
