The XAP document API exposes the space as [Document Store](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database). A document, which is represented by the class `SpaceDocument`, is essentially collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values are primitives, `String`, `Date`, other documents, or collections thereof. Most importantly, the Space is aware of the internal structure of a document, and thus can index document properties at any nesting level and expose rich query semantics for retrieving documents.
