        <h1>Data Integration (DI)</h1>
        <p>The Data Integration&#160;(DI) layer is a vital part of the Digital Integration Hub (DIH)&#160;platform. It is responsible for a wide ranger of data integration tasks as ingesting data in batches or streaming data changes. This is performed in real-time from various and multiple sources and systems of record. The data then resides in the In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG), or Space, of the Smart DIH&#160;platform.</p>
