XAP 10 introduced a new storage model called BlobStore Storage Model (commonly reffered to as MemoryXtend), which allows an external storage medium (one that does not reside on the JVM heap) to store the IMDG data. This guide describes the general architecture and functionality of this storage model that and its off-heap RAM and SSD implementations.

[Overview](./memoryxtend-overview.html)<br>
The BlobStore Storage Model allows an external storage medium (one that does not reside on the JVM heap) to store the IMDG data.

[Solid State Drive](./memoryxtend-ssd.html)<br>
All Enterprise flash drives are supported. SanDisk, Fusion-IO, IntelÂ® SSD , etc are supported with the IMDG storage technology.

[Off Heap RAM](./memoryxtend-ohr.html)<br>
XAP is using [MapDB](http://www.mapdb.org/), an embedded database engine which provides concurrent Maps, Sets and Queues backed by disk storage or off-heap memory.
