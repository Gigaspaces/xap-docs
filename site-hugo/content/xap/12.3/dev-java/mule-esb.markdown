XAP comes with comprehensive support for Mule v3.7. This allows you to use the Space as a Mule external transport, enabling receiving and dispatching of POJO messages over the Space using an [Event Container](./mule-event-container-transport.html).
An additional transport called os-queue allows you to replace the Mule VM transport with highly available inter VM transport over the Space.

A Mule application can be packaged and run as a [Processing Unit](./mule-processing-unit.html) within one of the SLA-driven Processing Unit containers.
