The directory provides the means for managing users and roles. User and role information stored in a persistent storage need to be accessed for authentication purposes and for management (adding/modifying,associating, etc.).

The `SecurityManager` access the directory for authenticating the user. The authentication process retrieves the user credentials and permissions. On the other hand, you need some tool to access the directory for managing the users/roles. It can be as simple as SQL statements modifying records in a database.

Our default _**file-based security implementation**_ uses a local file. Using the UI with the default security, you can add, modify, associate, remove users and roles which are saved to this local file. The UI calls upon the `DirectoryManager` implementation to perform these actions.

In general, if you are using the UI and the default file-based security than you probably don't need this API. If you need a command line tool to manage the users/roles you will probably need to write code either calling the default `DirectoryManager` implementation or write a custom implementation all together.

# Accessing the directory

The directory has clear distinction between user management and role management. For each there is an associated authority that can be granted to a user. For example, you may grant a user an authority to manage users but at the same time deny role management.

The default user which can access the default file-based security implementation is `admin/admin`. Note that this is specific to the implementation. You can remove `admin` after first log-in to the directory, but make sure to declare a new user with `MANAGE_USERS` and/or `MANAGE_ROLES` authorities.

# User Management

The [DirectoryManager]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/DirectoryManager.html) interface provides a means to managing users using the [UserManager]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/UserManager.html) API. Access should be granted only to users with `MANAGE_USERS` authority.

The [UserManager]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/UserManager.html) interface has simple methods for declaring users:


```java
public interface UserManager {
    ...
    void createUser(UserDetails)
    UserDetails getUser(String)
    void deleteUser(String)
    void updateUser(UserDetails)
    ...
}
```

# Role Management

The [DirectoryManage]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/DirectoryManager.html) interface provides a means to managing roles using the `RoleManager` API. Access should be granted only to users with **MANAGE_ROLES** authority.

The [RoleManager]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/RoleManager.html) interface has simple methods for declaring roles:


```java
public interface RoleManager {
    ...
    createRole(RoleDetails)
    RoleDetails getRole(String)
    deleteRole(String)
    updateRole(RoleDetails)
    ...
}
```

# Using the API

The directory manager is accessible via the [SecurityManager]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/SecurityManager.html). In our default implementation, the user `admin/admin` has both `MANAGE_USERS` and `MANAGE_ROLES`. We will use this user to gain access to the directory manager. Also, we have two default implementations [User]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/User.html) and [Role]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/Role.html) implementing [UserDetails]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/UserDetails.html) and [RoleDetails]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/RoleDetails.html) respectively.


```java
Properties securityProperties = new Properties();
SecurityManager securityManager = SecurityFactory.createSecurityManager(securityProperties);

DirectoryManager directoryManager = securityManager.createDirectoryManager(new User("admin", "admin"));
```

We can now add a new user using the [UserManager]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/UserManager.html) API. "Alice" will be added with `READ` authority for class "eg.ClassA".


```java
UserManager userManager = directoryManager.getUserManager();

userManager.createUser(new User("alice", "password",
        new SpaceAuthority(SpacePrivilege.READ, new ClassFilter("eg.ClassA"))
    ));
```

A role can be declared using the [RoleManager]({{% api-javadoc %}}/com/gigaspaces/security/directory/RoleManager.html) API. The "author" role will be added with `READ, WRITE, TAKE` authorities for class "eg.ClassA".


```java
RoleManager roleManager = directoryManager.getRoleManager();

roleManager.createRole(new Role("author",
        new SpaceAuthority(SpacePrivilege.READ, new ClassFilter("eg.ClassA")),
        new SpaceAuthority(SpacePrivilege.WRITE, new ClassFilter("eg.ClassA")),
        new SpaceAuthority(SpacePrivilege.TAKE, new ClassFilter("eg.ClassA"))
    ));
```

We can assign this role to user "bob".


```java
userManager.createUser(new User("bob", "password",
        new RoleAuthority("author")
    ));
```

The `ClassFilter` is one of the restrictive filters available. There is also a `RegexFilter`, `PackageFilter`, etc. A handy utility is the wildcard expression converter which converts a string expression to a filter. This is used by the UI dialog when creating filters.


```java
userManager.createUser(new User("carol", "password",
        new SpaceAuthority(SpacePrivilege.READ,
				WildcardExpressionToFilterConverter.convert(
						"eg.Class*", true))
    ));
```
