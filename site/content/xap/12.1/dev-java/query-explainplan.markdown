{{%warning%}}
This is an experimental feature. The API and usage might change in future releases.   
{{%/warning%}}


**Explain Plan** can be used to obtain a description of the strategy or plan that XAP uses to implement a specific `SQLQuery`. 
Explain Plan reports on the way in which the query uses indices and how many entries were scanned.

For detailed information how to assign index consult [indexing](./indexing.html#index-types)

##  Index Information

 - Indices that the space considered using and the selected index at each stage of the query.
 - Each cluster node may produce a different result.
 - Information breakdown is by Pojo  type.

##  Scanning Information

 - Number of entries the space scanned in order to find the matching entries and how many entries were matched.
 - Each cluster node may produce a different result.
 - Information breakdown is by Pojo  type.


# Index Types
The index type is determined by the SpaceIndexType enumeration. The index types are:

**NONE** - No indexing is used.<br>
**BASIC** - Basic index is used - this speeds up equality matches (equal to/not equal to).<br>
**EXTENDED** - Extended index - this speeds up comparison matches (bigger than/less than).


# Usage 

The execution plan is initiated by calling the `withExplainPlan()` method on the `SQLQuery`. After the query is executed the information is obtained with the `query.getExplainPlan()` method.

```java
SQLQuery<Person> query = new SQLQuery<Person>(Person.class, "age > 20")
        .withExplainPlan();
gigaSpace.readMultiple(query);
ExplainPlan explainPlan = query.getExplainPlan();
```
		
 

# Example

We use a `Person` class with several properties annotated with `@SpaceIndex` indicating that we want to use indexes when queries are performed.

```java
import java.util.UUID;

import com.gigaspaces.annotation.pojo.SpaceClass;
import com.gigaspaces.annotation.pojo.SpaceId;
import com.gigaspaces.annotation.pojo.SpaceIndex;

@SpaceClass
public class Person {
	private UUID id;
	private String country;
	private String gender;
	private Long age;
	
	@SpaceId
	public UUID getId() {
		return id;
	}
	@SpaceIndex
	public String getCountry() {
		return country;
	}
	
	@SpaceIndex
	public String getGender() {
		return gender;
	}
	
	@SpaceIndex
	public Long getAge() {
		return age;
	}
    .........
}

``` 

When different `SQLQuery` are executed against the space, we can display for each of them the plan that XAP chooses to execute the query.

**Query**

```java
SQLQuery<Person> query = new SQLQuery<Person>(Person.class, "age > ? ")
    .setParameter(1, 30L)
    .withExplainPlan();
gigaSpace.readMultiple(query);
System.out.println(query.getExplainPlan());
```
**Output**

```bash
