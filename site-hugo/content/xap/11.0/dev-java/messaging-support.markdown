XAP provide a JMS implementation, built on top of the core JavaSpaces layer. JMS messages are implemented as POJO, indexed, and routed to the relevant space partition according to the destination name. GigaSpaces XAP JMS implementation supports the unified messaging model, introduced in version 1.1 of the JMS specification.


{{%note%}}
Starting with 10.1, the JMS support has been moved out of the core into its own jar files. When using JMS, please include the jar files located under `[XAP-HOME]/lib/optional/jms`
in your runtime configuration.
