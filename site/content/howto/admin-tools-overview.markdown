GigaSpaces offers several administration tools that can be used to manage your XAP-based or InsightEdge-based application. The GigaSpaces Management Center provides a visual user interface for managing the users and roles, and comprehensive administration capabilities of the system. The Web Management Console provides a light, web-based user interface for administration of Space and Processing Unit components in the service grid. The Command Line Interface provides a wide range of administration capabilities based on the REST Manager API, along with means for automation using non-interactive mode. The Admininstration API provides top-level management and monitoring of all the XAP components.

You can opt to perform administration and maintenance via any of the above tools, based on the needs of your environment and the actions supported per tool.

{{% bgcolor yellow %}}(NOTE TO TW: add small subsection that describes the high-level capabilities of each admin tool, and how to activate/configure it where applicable. This can be within the overview topic, or outside it if necessary). Copy this information from the existing intro topics for each tool.{{% /bgcolor %}}

{{% bgcolor yellow %}}Also, we probably also need two additional intro topics -- one to come before the topics that describe how to administer Spaces and Processing Units, and one to come before the topics that describe Administering the Service Grid. In general, the topics should be ordered from basic to advanced.){{% /bgcolor %}}
