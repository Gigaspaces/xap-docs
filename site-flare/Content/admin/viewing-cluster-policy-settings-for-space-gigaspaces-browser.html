<h1>Policy Settings</h1>
  

<p>When you select a space node in the Cluster Tree, the information panel shows configuration details for that space, in the context of the attributes of its group. For example, if a space belongs to a replication and load balancing group, the information panel shows its replication and load balancing settings.</p>

<h1><a name="viewing-replication-settings"></a>Viewing Replication Settings</h1>

<p>To view the replication settings of a space, first select it by clicking its node in the tree or double-clicking it in the visual display area. In the information panel, click the <span class="tc-bold">Replication</span> tab, then the internal tab <span class="tc-bold">Settings</span>. The <span class="tc-bold">Replication</span> tab can be clicked only if the space belongs to a replication group.
For more information on these settings, see <a href="replication-group-gigaspaces-browser.html">Replication Options</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="viewing-load-balancing-settings"></a>Viewing Load-Balancing Settings</h1>

In the output generated above, the <span class="tc-bold">Class Name</span> is the name of the instance used, while its corresponding count is the number of objects per instance. When an Entry is highlighted, the lower pane shows the name of the object selected (<span class="tc-italic">Name</span>), its field type (<span class="tc-bold">Type</span>) and whether or not it is indexed (<span class="tc-bold">true</span> or <span class="tc-bold">false</span>).</p>
