# Overview

Organizations often require quick insight into data to understand the business impact, and don't want to waste valuable time consulting their corporate IT team. With the [In-Grid SQL Query]({{%latestjavaurl%}}/sql-query-intro.html) feature,
this can be done using the data stored in the XAP in-memory data grid. [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) can be connected to the XAP data grid via an ODBC-JDBC gateway, in order to retrieve and present the required data in a visual format.

This topic provides a demo for integrating Tableau with InsightEdge in a Microsoft Windows environment, so that the In-Grid SQL Query can be used to retrieve data and display it in a graphic visual representation.

## Architecture

Tableau can connect to the XAP data grid using the SQL-99-compatible JDBC driver that is provided with the In-Grid SQL Query feature. However, Tableau can only use ODBC as a general connection option, so a third-party ODBC-JDBC connection is required to convert ODBC requests from Tableau into JDBC requests for the InsightEdge JDBC driver.

## Sample Data Set

In this example, a familiar `Simple - Superstore` Tableau users data set is used. The original schema is too simple to show the join capabilities, so some additions were made to the model, namely that location information is referenced by the orders entity. The updated schema is as follows:

# Configuration

## Configuring InsightEdge for the Tableau demo

In order to integrate Tableau with InsightEdge, you must have a XAP data grid that is up and running, and you need access to it. InsightEdge application includes the XAP data grid as a core component.

After you start your InsightEdge application, you must set up the system to run the Tableau demo.

##### Deploying XAP Data Grid and Space

Preparatory step: installing insightedge dependencies locally

1. Run ${XAP_HOME}/tools/installmavenrep.bat script.

1. Run ${XAP_HOME}/insightedge/tools/maven/insightedge-maven.cmd script.

On your local machine, run the following commands from the `$XAP_HOME\bin` directory:

1. XAP data grid:
    ```bash
    insightedge host run-agent --auto --gsc=2
    ```
1. To create a Space with the name `tableauSpace`:
    ```bash
    insightedge space deploy --partitions=2 tableauSpace
    ```
1. Populate the `tableauSpace` Space with data: 

	- [Download](/download_files/sbp/xap-sql-demo.rar) this file and unpack it
	- Under the extracted "xap-sql-demo" folder, build the sample with `mvn clean install`
	- Execute the following command:
	```bash
	java -jar target\xap-sql-demo.jar --space-url "jini://*/*/tableauSpace?locators=127.0.0.1" --lookup-group <DATA_GRID_LOOKUP_GROUP>
	```

	- Substitute the value `<DATA_GRID_LOOKUP_GROUP>` with appropriate value for your deployment. lookup-group is optional.


1. View the objects in the Space to verify that the data populated as expected.

## Setting Up Tableau

Download and install [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) desktop.

After the XAP data grid has been populated with the sample data, and the ODBC-JDBC Gateway has been configured to connect to InsightEdge, you can configure Tableau to read the data and display it in a graphic visual format. You can then query the data grid and see the activity that occurs under the hood when Tableau accesses XAP as a SQL database and reads the requested data. 

### Configuring the Data Source

Tableau has to be configured to use the ODBC-JDBC gateway as the data source.

**To configure the ODBC-JDBC gateway:**

1. Start Tableau.
1. Click Connect in the Tableau desktop, and select **Other Database (ODBC)** as the data source.

	<img src="/attachment_files/sbp/tableau/tableau_0.png" width=243" height="245" />

1. In the Other Databases (ODBC) window, configure the options as follows:	

	a. In the **Connect Using** area, defin the DSN:
	- Select **easysoft-xap-odbc-jdbc**
	- Click **Connect**.

	b. In the *Connection Attributes** area, provide the name of the database:
	
	- In the **Database** field, type **space**.

1. Click **Sign In**.
 
	<img src="/attachment_files/sbp/tableau/tableau_2_1.png" width=310" height="496" /> 

1. Under **Connections**, click the search icon in the **Schema** area and select **space**.

	{{%infosign%}} The sample data for this demo contains a Space called **space**. If you have additional Spaces in your InsightEdge environment, they may appear in this list.

	<img src="/attachment_files/sbp/tableau/tableau_3.png" width=213" height="267" /> 
 
1. Verify that Tableau can see the sample data by peforming a table search.  You should see **Locations** and **Orders** in the list of tables.

	<img src="/attachment_files/sbp/tableau/tableau_1.png" width=229" height="155" />  

### Querying the Data Grid

Before performing a query on the data grid, you can use the GigaSpaces Management Center to look at the Space that contains the sample data. At this point, there have been no read operations.

<img src="/attachment_files/sbp/tableau/xap_2.png" width=500" height="324" /> 
 
Everything that needs to be configured has been set up, and you can execute queries against the data in the grid.

**To query the data in InsightEdge:**

1. From the Data tab, drag and drop the **Orders** and **Locations** tables to the data pane.
1. Join the tables as **Inner**.

	<img src="/attachment_files/sbp/tableau/tableau_2.png" width=595" height="346" /> 
 
1. Below the data pane, select the **Sheet1** tab.
1. Select **Country** and **State** from the **Locations** node using standard Windows functionality (press the **Ctrl** key while selecting).
1. Right click and select **Create Hierarchy** from the menu that is displayed.

	<img src="/attachment_files/sbp/tableau/tableau_4.png" width=338" height="347" />  
 
1. Double-click **State**.
1. From the **Measures** area, drag and drop **Sales** to the Size option in the Marks card, and **Profit** to the Color option.
1. View the results in the data pane; you can easily see the sales-profit insight that was derived from the data retrieved from the XAP data grid.

	<img src="/attachment_files/sbp/tableau/tableau_5.png" width=770" height="388" />

1. In the GigaSpaces Management Center, view the Space operations statistics. You can see the read operations that were performed when Tableau accessed the XAP data grid to construct the view:
