<h1>Security</h1>
  

<p>This section provides an understanding of GigaSpaces Security features, where they fit in the GigaSpaces architecture, which components can be secured, and how to configure and customize the security depending on your application security requirements. XAP Security provides comprehensive support for securing your data, services, or both. GigaSpaces provides a set of authorities granting privileged access to data, and for performing operations on services.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>Some security features are part of the open source edition, while others are only available with the commercial (licensed) editions.</p>
</div>

<h1><a name="security-infrastructure-for-open-source-editions">&#160;</a>Security Infrastructure for Open Source Editions</h1>

<p>The GigaSpaces applictions come with a basic security infrastructure that can be configured to suit the needs of your organization. You can secure the <a href="securing-your-data.html">data layer</a>, which includes the Spaces and Processing Units, by defining the following elements for user authorities and roles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data access privileges</li>
<li>Operation privileges</li>
<li>Monitoring privileges</li>
<li>System administration privileges</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also configure auditing for operations on the data grid, and secure the SSL transport layer.</p>

<p>The open source editions do not include a security implementation. A <a href="security-ref-impl.html">reference implementation</a> is provided instead.</p>

<h1><a name="security-implementations-for-commercial-editions">&#160;</a>Security Implementations for Commercial Editions</h1>

<p>The commercial editions of XAP and InsightEdge come with an Admin API that can be used for administration and monitoring. Additionally, the following interfaces can also be used:</p>

<ul>
<li>GigaSpaces Management Center</li>
<li>Command Line Interface</li>
<li>Web Management Console</li>
<li>Rest Manager API</li>
</ul>

<p>The administration and monitoring tools interact with the application layers as follows.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-refer">
  
  <p>Refer to <a href="../admin/admin-tools.html">Administration Tools</a> for details about the configuration options.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="securable-layers">&#160;</a>Securable Layers</h2>

<p>XAP security can be applied in three separate layers. You can enable security for any of the layers individually, or you can enable all of them for maximum security.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="securing-your-data.html">data layer</a> - You can declare a secured Space or Processing Unit.</li>
<li>The <a href="securing-the-grid-services.html">grid layer</a> - You can declare the data grid as secured. Includes the grid components (GSA, GSM, GSC, XAP Manager).</li>
<li>The <a href="securing-the-transport-layer-using-ssl.html">transport layer</a> - Provides a generic network filter with SSL support.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="configuring-security">&#160;</a>Configuring Security</h2>

<p>Security is configured via a property file that includes required and custom properties. For more information, refer to the following parts of the Security section in this Administration guide:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="security-configurations.html">Space and Processing Unit</a> - Includes configuration options for the properties file.</li>
<li><a href="security-configurations-ext.html">Grid components</a> - Includes configuration options for the grid components.</li>
<li><a href="../admin/tools-web-ui.html#security">Web Management Console</a> - Includes configurations for authenticating with secure XAP components.</li>
<li><a href="../admin/admin-rest-manager-api.html#security">REST Manager API</a> - Includes security and SSL configurations for secured RESTful API support.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>When no property file is configured, there is a fallback implementation mainly used for testing or to get you started.
This implementation stores the user credentials in a local file and can be used to demonstrate that security has been applied.</p>

<p>Refer to the following sections for more information about the XAP security implementations:</p>

<ul>
<li>To read more about the XAP file-based configuration options, refer to <a href="default-file-based-security-implementation-ext.html">Default File-Based Security</a>.</li>
<li>To write your own implementation, refer to <a href="security-ref-impl.html">Reference Implementation</a>, which uses MongoDB.</li>
<li>For other custom security implementations, refer to <a href="custom-security.html">Custom Security</a>. One such custom security implementation is the <a href="spring-security-bridge.html">Spring Security Bridge</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="dependencies">&#160;</a>Dependencies</h2>

<p>In order to use the security implementation, include the <code>${XAP_HOME}/lib/optional/security/xap-security.jar</code> file on your classpath or use Maven dependencies:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.gigaspaces&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;xap-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;[%=Versions.maven-version%]&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2><a name="hello-world-example">&#160;</a>Hello World Example</h2>

<p>The <a href="securing-the-helloworld-example.html">Hello World</a> example provides a step-by-step guide to deploying a Processing Unit with a secured Space, accessing it from a remote proxy, and declaring principals using the administration tools.</p>

<h2><a name="spring-security">&#160;</a>Spring Security</h2>

<p>Spring Security is one of the most mature and widely used Spring projects. GigaSpaces provides a Spring-based security bridge to enable an extensible implementation to LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or database authentication.</p>
