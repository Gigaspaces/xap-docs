XAP has several administration tools that can be used to manage the security aspects of your XAP-based application. The GUI provides a handy management tool for managing the users and roles, and comprehensive manageability of the secured components in the system. The CLI provides means for automation using the non-interactive mode. The Admin API provides a top level management and monitoring of all the GigaSpaces components.


- [Command Line Interface](./command-line-interface-cli-security.html) - The CLI has a non-interactive mode for secure login, and can be used for script automation, and to handle any management/monitoring tasks that aren't available via the XAP Management Center.
- [Administration and Monitoring API](./administration-and-monitoring-api-security.html) - This API can be used to administer and monitor security on GSAs, XAP Managers, GSCs, LUSs, Processing Units, and Spaces that are currently running.
- [Auditing](./auditing.html) - You can audit authentication requests on secured services. You can also audit Space operations.
- [Java Security Policy](./java-security-policy-file.html) - You can use the default settings of the java.security.policy property, or customize them to suit your application and environment needs.
