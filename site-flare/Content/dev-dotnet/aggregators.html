        <h1>Aggregators</h1>
        <p>With many systems such as pricing systems, risk management, trading and other analytic and business intelligence applications you may need to perform an aggregation activity across data stored within the data grid when generating reports or when running some business process. Such activity can leverage data stored in memory and will be much faster than performing it with a database.
XAP provides common functionality to perform aggregations across the space. There is no need to retrieve the entire data set from the space to the client side , iterate the result set and perform the aggregation. This would be an expensive activity as it might return large amount of data into the client application.</p>
        <p>Built-in Aggregators allow you to perform the entire aggregation activity at the space side avoiding any data retrieval back to the client side. Only the result of each aggregation activity performed with each partition is returned back to the client side where all the results are reduced and returned to the client application. Such aggregation activity utilize the partitioned nature of the data-grid allowing each partition to execute the aggregation with its local data in parallel, where all the partitions intermediate results are fully aggregated at the client side using the relevant reducer implementation.</p>
        <h2><a name="how-aggregators-works">&#160;</a>How Do Aggregators Work?</h2>
        <p>Aggregators are executed by iterating the internal data grid structure that maintains the space objects. There is no materialization of the original user data grid object when performing this iteration (scan). This allows relatively fast scan. There is no need to index the aggregated fields (paths) - only the fields (paths) used to execute the query used to generate the result set scanned to calculate the aggregation. Future XAP releases may use indexes to perform the aggregation.</p>
        <h1><a name="supported-aggregators">&#160;</a>Supported Aggregators</h1>
        <p>XAP comes with several built-in Aggregators you may use. The aggregation process executed across all data grid partitions when using a partitioned data grid , or across the proxy master replica when using a replicated data grid. You may rout the aggregation into a specific partition.</p>

        <h1><a name="interoperability">&#160;</a>Interoperability</h1>
        <p>Aggregators may be performed on any data generated by any type of client. For example - A call for Aggregation from a .NET application may be performed on space objects that were written into the space using .NET application using the XAP.NET API or C++ application using the XAP C++ API. Same for a call from .NET Aggregation API for data written into the space via a .NET application.</p>
