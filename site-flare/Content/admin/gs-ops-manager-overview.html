        <p> The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> Ops Manager is an enterprise-grade management platform that can be implemented for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />-based applications across on-premise, cloud, and Kubernetes environments. Ops&#160;Manager is a robust web interface that provides visibility and real-time information about your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> clusters and their services. It enables you to better monitor your clusters, and perform troubleshooting activities by analyzing various performance metrics, and reviewing alerts with defined thresholds. You can drill down to the partition level and create dump files, to review service log files for root-cause analysis.</p>
        <p>In addition to real-time monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities, Ops Manager enables you to review and analyze data that resides within the cluster. Use Ops Manager to review Space-related information, such as object types and properties, and execute various queries as part of data discovery.</p>

            <h1>Accessing Ops Manager in a Secure Environment</h1>
            <p>When using role-based authentication, Ops manager uses three properties to authenticate the user and allow access to Ops manager functions</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User name</li>
                <li>Password</li>

                <li><b>Admin</b> (superuser) – has access to all capabilities, including features related to service orchestration, that have a  high impact on the environment and resource consumption (e.g. scale up/down of service partitions).</li>
                <li><b>Manager</b> – deploys services and connects with client applications and other components such as databases, ETL’s etc. A manager will deploy and test for the proper function and performance. A manager may also analyze the data behavior within the Space.</li>
                <li><b>Viewer</b> – data expert with a goal to view, interact with and query the data.</li>

        <p>The Ops Manager is deployed along with the Manager and the REST&#160;Manager API, and uses the same entry point. In order to open Ops Manager in your browser and view your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> environment, you need to access the Manager's IP&#160;address on port 8090, or use <span class="tc-bold">localhost</span> if your environment is deployed on a local agent. </p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>If you had a previous version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />,  when you used the Manager IP&#160;address and port in the URL field of your browser to access the REST&#160;Manager API (<span class="tc-italic">http://&lt;MANAGER_IP&gt;:8090/</span>), you were automatically redirected to <span class="tc-italic">http://&lt;MANAGER_IP&gt;:8090/v2</span>. This information may be stored in your browser cache and prevent you from opening Ops Manager. If this occurs, clear your browser cache to enable access to Ops Manager. If you want to open the REST&#160;Manager API, use the <span class="tc-italic">http://&lt;MANAGER_IP&gt;:8090/v2</span> URL.</p>
