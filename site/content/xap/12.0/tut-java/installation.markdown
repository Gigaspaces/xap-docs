# Download
Download the latest XAP release {{%download "http://www.gigaspaces.com/xap-download"%}}<br>

# Installation
- Unzip the distribution into a working directory; GS_HOME<br>
- Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the JDK root directory<br>
- Start your favorite Java IDE<br>
- Create a new project<br>
- Include all jar files from the GS_HOME/lib/required in the classpath<br>


# Maven
 
XAP is Maven-friendly - it is built using maven and designed to be easily used by developers constructing XAP applications.  
  
  
The main dependency required to use XAP is `xap-openspaces`
 
 ```xml
 <dependency>
   <groupId>org.gigaspaces</groupId>
   <artifactId>xap-openspaces</artifactId>
   <version>{{%version "maven-version" %}}</version>
 </dependency>
 ```
 
 Since XAP artifacts are currently not published in Maven Central Repo, you'll also need to configure a repository:
 
 ```xml
 <repository>
    <id>org.openspaces</id>
    <url>http://maven-repository.openspaces.org</url>
 </repository>
 ```
 
#  Examples

There are two examples provided with the Open Source distribution. You can find them under the `<XAP root>/examples` directory. The examples are also available on github(see links below).


[Hello World](https://github.com/xap/xap/tree/master/xap-examples/hello-world)<br>
The Hello World example demonstrates how to perform basic Space operations - e.g. writing and reading an Object from the data-grid.
This example also covers different deployment modes: embedded, remote and partitioned.  

[Hola Mundo](https://github.com/xap/xap/tree/master/xap-examples/hola-mundo)   <br>
This example builds on the previous example, introducing the concepts of event-processing using a Processing Unit.
This example also demonstrates how to run with the IDE.
