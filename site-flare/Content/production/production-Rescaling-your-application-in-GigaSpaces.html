        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Rescaling Your Application in <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /></h1>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />, an application can be configured to run in any number of partitions, with a defined amount of RAM and CPU resources for each partition.  This initial scaling is done when the application/processing unit is deployed. </p>
        <p>It is critically important to be able to rescale an application while it is online, without downtime or performance degradation. GS provides this capability.</p>
        <p>GS allows two kinds of dynamic, online rescaling: vertical scaling, and horizontal scaling.</p>
        <h1>Vertical Scaling</h1>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>This is only relevant for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" /> when using Kubernetes Orchestration</p>
        </div>
        <p><b>Vertical scaling</b>, referred to as <b href="production-Scale-Up-Down.html">On Demand Scale Up/Down</b>, allows  the amount of RAM and CPU to be increased or decreased - without downtime - for an active GigaSpaces cluster.</p>
        <p>For example, additional memory or CPUs may be added to an existing physical node.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">

        </p>
        <p>On Demand Scale Up/Down can be used for applications that have many "atomic" transactions (logical units of work), often using relational databases.</p>
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Resources are located close physical proximity. <br />This allows faster access to related data, such as credit/debit table updates in a closed (atomic) unit of work..</li>
            <li>Performance gain, because you have more RAM and CPU on each update.<br />For example, if an application expects a significant increase in resource requirements at 9 am daily, the system may be scaled up to perhaps 20 times greater CPU capacity from 9 am to 9:15 am each day. In this way, SLA/performance levels can be met consistently throughout the day.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use Case</h2>
        <p>Vertical scaling can be used for a traditional DBMS (Database Management System) where atomic transactions are performed in the same physical node.</p>
        <h1>Horizontal Scaling</h1>
        <p>Horizontal scaling, referred to as <b><a href="production-Scale-Out-In.html">On Demand Scale Out/In</a></b>, means to add or reduce the number of partitions used for an application.</p>
        <p>For example, additional partitions may be created in the same server, or alternatively, servers may be added or removed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/Scaling-example-of-horizontal-scaling.jpg" class="tc-picture60" />
        </p>
        <p>Big data is often stored in geographically dispersed nodes, which includes partitioning of databases.</p>
        <p>If the application involves few cross-partition joins, it may be appropriate for On Demand Scale Out/In.</p>
        <p>NoSQL databases often use On Demand Scale Out/In.</p>
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Horizontal scaling can be less expensive than vertical scaling - it is generally less expensive to add cloud storage, than to purchase new physical machines.</li>
            <li>This method of rescaling provides resilience and fault tolerance - with more partitions, the impact of a partition failure is lessened.</li>
            <li>Horizontal scaling supports linear increases in capacity on the fly - RAM or CPU capacity can be increased or decreased while maintaining a constant RAM:CPU ratio .</li>
        </ul>
