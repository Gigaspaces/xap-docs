[Administration Tools](./admin-tools.html)<br>
Describes the various administration tools that GigaSpaces provides to configure, monitor, and maintain XAP- and InsightEdge-based applications.

[Administering Spaces and Processing Units](./admin-spaces-pu.html)<br>
Tasks that users may perform on the Space and Processing Unit components in the system as part of setting up and running the system, such as deploying a Space or Processing Unit, viewing runtime and configuration information, and viewing system statistics and container information.

[Administering the Service Grid](./admin-service-grid.html)<br>
Tasks that users may perform on the service grid as part of monitoring and managing the system, such as viewing host resources, managing containers, viewing logs and events, and generating dump files for analysis.

[Administering InsightEdge](./admin-insightedge.html)<br>
Provides information about clustering and logging for InsightEdge, along with tasks that users may perform when configuring and managing Spark-based applications.

[Data Grid Clustering](./data-grid-clustering.html)<br>
Describes how in memory data grid clustering works. It also provides details of the failover, load-balancing, and replication facilities used.

[Service Level Agreement (SLA)](./the-sla-overview.html)<br>
The XAP runtime environment (Service Grid) provides Service Level Agreement driven capabilities.

[MemoryXtend](./memoryxtend-overview.html)<br>
This storage interface allows Blob/Block/external type storage to act as a natural memory space for the in memory data grid.

[Logging](./logging-overview.html)<br>
Explains how to configure logging with XAP. This includes formatting the log output, and selecting file names and rollover policies.

[The Service Grid](./runtime-configuration.html)<br>
Lists and explains the different runtime configuration parameters.

[Network Configuration](./network.html)<br>
Explains how to configure the network in order for XAP to work properly.

[Monitoring](./monitoring.html)<br>
Describes how to monitor XAP and your deployed application.

[Metrics](./metrics-overview.html)<br>
Describes the core metrics concepts, and how to configure metrics collection.

[Performance Tuning](./tuning.html) <br>
Explains how to tune your XAP application. Covers topics like JVM tuning, thread usage and benchmarking.

[Benchmarking](./benchmarking.html)<br>
Performance benchmarks with XAP's in memory data grid mainly involve testing latency and throughput.

[Quiesce Mode](./quiescemode.html)<br>
Processing Units can be put into maintenance mode. When a Processing Unit is in maintenance mode, it rejects all data-related operations with an exception. This is useful when performing a safe shutdown or for a rolling system upgrade.

[Security](../security/index.html)<br>
Explains GigaSpaces XAP security, where it fits in the GigaSpaces architecture, which components can be secured, and how to configure and customize the security depending on your application security requirements.

[XAP as a Windows Service](./installation-windows-service.html)<br>
When using a Windows-based operating system for running GigaSpaces infrastructure, users may want to convert the Grid Service Agent into a Windows service.

[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.html)<br>
Provides useful information on how to troubleshoot your XAP application.
