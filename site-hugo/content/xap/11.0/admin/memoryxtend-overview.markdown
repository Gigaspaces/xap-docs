XAP 10 introduced a new storage model called BlobStore Storage Model (commonly reffered to as MemoryXtend), which allows an external storage medium (one that does not reside on the JVM heap) to store the IMDG data. This guide describes the general architecture and functionality of this storage model that and its off-heap RAM and SSD implementations.

[Overview](./memoryxtend.html)<br>
The BlobStore Storage Model allows an external storage medium (one that does not reside on the JVM heap) to store the IMDG data.

[RocksDB Add-On](./memoryxtend-rocksdb-ssd.html)<br>
XAP provides a MemoryXtend add-on based on RocksDB, which is the recommended choice for hybrid RAM-SSD clusters.


[Off Heap RAM](./memoryxtend-ohr.html)<br>
XAP is using [MapDB](http://www.mapdb.org/), an embedded database engine which provides concurrent Maps, Sets and Queues backed by disk storage or off-heap memory.
