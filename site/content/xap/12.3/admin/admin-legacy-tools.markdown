The topics in this section describe older versions of the administration tools that are available for use with XAP. We encourage users to adopt the updated tools that are described in the [Administration Tools](./admin-tools.html) section, such as the new interactive Command Line Interface that supports both XAP and InsightEdge, and V2 of the REST Manager API that contains updated terminology.
