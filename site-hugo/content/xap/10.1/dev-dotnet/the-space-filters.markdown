A Space Filter is a special hook point inside the engine that enables integration with external systems, or implementation of user defined logic. There are two ways to implement such a filter and integrate it with the space, both of which are covered in this page.

# Integrating the Space Filter with a Space

A space filter is integrated into a space upon creation of that space.

Each space filter that integrates with a space, needs a `SpaceFilterConfig` instance that defines it.

A `SpaceFilterConfig` can be created in two ways, depending on the implementation of the filter itself.

#### Implementing the ISpaceFilter Interface

If the filter implements the `ISpaceFilter Interface`, then a `SpaceFilterConfig` needs to be created for it, and each operation that needs to be filtered should be added to the `FilterOperations` list, as in the following code:


```csharp
SpaceFilterConfig mySpaceFilterConfig = new SpaceFilterConfig();
mySpaceFilterConfig.FilterOperations = new List<FilterOperation>(new FilterOperation[]{ FilterOperation.BeforeWrite });
mySpaceFilterConfig.Filter = new MySpaceFilter();
```

#### Implementing a Space Filter using SpaceFilterOperationDelegate

If the filter is based on the `SpaceFilterOperationDelegate`, then a `SpaceFilterConfig` needs to be created. This is done with the appropriate `SpaceFilterConfigFactory`, either `AttributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory`, or `MethodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory`, using the `CreateSpaceFilterConfig()` method.

Once a `SpaceFilterConfig` is created, it needs to be used when starting the space.


```csharp
spaceConfig.SpaceFiltersConfig = new List<SpaceFilterConfig>();
spaceConfig.Add(mySpaceFilterConfig);

ISpaceProxy embeddedSpace = GigaSpacesFactory.FindSpace("/./mySpace", spaceConfig);
```

{{% note %}}
A space can have multiple space filters integrated in it. Simply create a `SpaceFilterConfig` instance per filter, and add it to the `SpaceFiltersConfig` list.

# ISpaceFilterEntry interface

An `ISpaceFilterEntry` represents an object in the context of a filter operation, and allows you to interact with it.

This interface consists of 2 methods and 2 properties.


```csharp
public interface ISpaceFilterEntry
{
  // Gets the object type
  Type ObjectType { get; }

  // Gets the object itself
  object GetObject();

  // Update the object contained within this entry state
  void UpdateObject(object obj);

  // Gets the notify type (relevant for Notification filter operations)
  DataEventType NotifyType { get; }
}
```

When using the `ISpaceFilterEntry`, performance issues should be taken into consideration. This interface is designed to be used in a lazy evaluation fashion. `GetObject` and `UpdateObject` are evaluated only when called, and they reduce performance. Therefore they should only be used when necessary.



# ISpaceFilter Interface

The `ISpaceFilter` interface implements IDisposable and consists of 3 additional methods.


```csharp
public interface ISpaceFilter : IDisposable
{
  void Init(ISpaceProxy proxy, string filterId, IDictionary<string, string> customProperties, FilterPriority priority)
  {
    // performs operation on initialization
  }
  void Process(SecurityContext securityContext, ISpaceFilterEntry entry, FilterOperation operation)
  {
    // performs single entry filter operations
  }

  void Process(SecurityContext securityContext, ISpaceFilterEntry firstEntry, ISpaceFilterEntry secondEntry, FilterOperation operation)
  {
    // performs two entries filter operations, such as update
  }
  //IDisposable implementation
  void Dispose()
  {
    // performs operation when the filter is being disposed
  }
}
```

The FilterOperation enum specifies which space operation is being executed and at which stage. For example, a write operation will result in two filter Process method calls, one before the write is executed (BeforeWrite) and one after the write is executed (AfterWrite). These give the filter two hook points to intervene in the process.

Both Process methods receive either one or two `ISpaceFilterEntry` entries. These entries represent the objects in the context of the filtered operation. For example, in the case of a BeforeWrite filter operation, the space filter entry will contain the object that is being written to the space.

{{% note %}}
If the filter uses the proxy received by the `Init` method, one should be careful not to cause recursive calls. For example, if your filter is filtering Before Write operations, and inside one of the Process methods there's a call to write, an infinite loop might occur.

# SpaceFilterConfig

The `SpaceFilterConfig` is used to start a space integrated with a space filter.


|Name|Description|
|-----------|---------------|
| `Name` | The name of the space filter. |
| `IsActiveWhenBackup` | States if this filter is active when the space is in backup mode. |
| `IsSecurityFilter` | States if this filter is a security filter. |
| `ShutdownSpaceOnInitFailure` | States if the space should shutdown on filter init failure. |
| `Priority` | The filter's [priority](#priority). |
| `FilterOperations` | The list of [operations](#priority) to be filtered. |
| `CustomProperties` | List of properties to be passed to the filter on initialization. |
| `Enabled` | Is this filter enabled. |
| `Filter` | The filter itself (an instance implementing ISpaceFilter). |

A filter is integrated into a space upon creation of that space, and each space filter that integrates with a space needs a `SpaceFilterConfig` instance that defines it.

The following code starts an embedded space, with a space filter that implements `ISpaceFilter`:


```csharp
SpaceFilterConfig mySpaceFilterConfig = new SpaceFilterConfig();
mySpaceFilterConfig.FilterOperations = new List<FilterOperations>(new FilterOperation[]{ FilterOperation.BeforeWrite });
mySpaceFilterConfig.Filter = new MySpaceFilter();

SpaceConfig spaceConfig = new SpaceConfig();
spaceConfig.SpaceFiltersConfig = new List<SpaceFilterConfig>();
spaceConfig.SpaceFiltersConfig.Add(mySpaceFilterConfig);

ISpaceProxy embeddedSpace = GigaSpacesFactory.FindSpace("/./mySpace", spaceConfig);
```

{{% anchor priority %}}

## FilterOperation and its Relevance to Priority

Filters are grouped by priorities, and activated by a specific operation.

Filters with higher priorities are activated closer to the hook point. This means that:

- Before filters (filters with lower priorities), will be activated first.
- After filters (filters with higher priorities), will be activated first.

For example, if two filters are activated at BeforeWrite and AfterWrite operation, the filter with the higher priority is activated last at the BeforeWrite operation, and first at the AfterWrite operation. Doing that keeps this filter activation closer to the actual space operation, hence, closer to the hook point.


# Space Filter Operation Delegate

An `ISpaceFilter` implementation that acts as an adapter, delegating the execution of the filter life-cycle methods and specific operation, to pluggable reflection-based methods.

Using it, dismisses the need to implement the `ISpaceFilter` interface, and gives a more declarative filtering method.

There are two ways to use the `SpaceFilterOperationDelegate`:

- Attribute-based implementation.
- Method name-based implementation.

# Attribute-Based Implementation

The filter itself is a class that doesn't need to implement any interface. Instead, the filter methods are marked with specific attributes.


```csharp
public class SimpleAttributeFilter
{
  [OnFilterInit]
  public void Initialize()
  {
    // performs operation on initialization
  }

  [BeforeWrite]
  public void ReportBeforeWrite()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now + ": Before Write");
  }
}
```

To use this class as the filter, simply use the `AttributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory` to create a `SpaceFilterConfig` instance, and use when starting a space integrated with the space filter.


```csharp
AttributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory filterConfigFactory = new AttributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory();
filterConfigFactory.Filter = new SimpleAttributeFilter();

// use this filter config when starting a space
SpaceFilterConfig filterConfig = filterConfigFactory.CreateSpaceFilterConfig();
```

The `AttributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory` creates a `SpaceFilterConfig` instance, using a fully constructed `SpaceFilterOperationDelegate` as its Filter instance. The `SpaceFilterOperationDelegate` acts as the `ISpaceFilter` implementation, and delegates the filter operation to the `SpaceAttributeFilter` instance.

# Method Name-Based Implementation

A method name-based filter has the same basic principle as the one above. However, instead of using attributes to mark the method, the method names are specified by properties.


```csharp
public class SimpleMethodNameFilter
{
  public void Initialize()
  {
    // performs operation on initialization
  }

  public void ReportBeforeWrite()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now + ": Before Write");
  }
}

...

MethodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory filterConfigFactory = new MethodNameFilterConfigFactory();
filterConfigFactory.Filter = new SimpleAttributeFilter();
filterConfigFactory.OnFilterInit = "Initialize";
filterConfigFactory.BeforeWrite = "ReportBeforeWrite";
// use this filter config when starting a space
SpaceFilterConfig filterConfig = filterConfigFactory.CreateSpaceFilterConfig();
```

# How the SpaceFilterOperationDelegate Works

The `SpaceFilterOperationDelegate` holds a map of `FilterOperationDelegateInvoker` for each filtered operation, which contains the logic that is used to delegate the filter operation to the supplied method.

The supplied method parameters (e.g. in the code example above, the `ReportBeforeWrite` method) must maintain a certain structure:

- A no parameter method callback - e.g. `ReportBeforeWrite()`.
- A single parameter: the parameter can either be an `ISpaceFilterEntry`, or the actual template object wrapped by the entry.

{{% info %}}
Note, if using actual types, this delegate filters out all the types that are not assignable to it - e.g. `ReportBeforeWrite(ISpaceFilterEntry entry)`, or `ReportBeforeWrite(SimpleMessage message)`.
{{%/info%}}

- Two parameters: the first one maps to the previous option, the second one is the `FilterOperation` - e.g. `ReportBeforeWrite(SimpleMessage message, FilterOperation operation)`.
- Three parameters: the first two map to the previous option, the third one is a `SecurityContext` - e.g.  `ReportBeforeWrite(SimpleMessage message, FilterOperation operation, SecurityContext securityContext)`.

Some filter operations have two entries, and therefore have a similar, but different structure:

- A no parameter method callback - e.g. `ReportAfterUpdate()`
- A single parameter: the parameter can either be an `ISpaceFilterEntry` or the actual template object wrapped by the entry.

{{% info %}}
Note, if using actual types, this delegate filters out all the types that are not assignable to it - e.g. `ReportAfterUpdate(ISpaceFilterEntry entry)`, or `ReportAfterUpdate(SimpleMessage message)`.
{{%/info%}}

- Two parameters: the first one maps to the previous option, the second is the same as the first one, since multiple entries always have two entries (mainly for update operations).
- Three parameters: the first two map to the previous option, the third one is the `FilterOperation`.
- Four parameters: the first three map to the previous option, the fourth one is a `SecurityContext`.

The filter initialization method parameter structure is different. It can receive no parameters, or one parameter which is an `ISpaceProxy`.

If your filter needs to do things upon termination, implement the `IDisposable` interface, and the `Dispose()` method will be invoked when the space is shutting down.

{{% note %}}
When your filter method needs to update the entry itself, `ISpaceFilterEntry` should be used, and a call to `UpdateObject` needs to be made.

# Example

The Space Filter Demo demonstrates the different ways to implement  a space filter  and how to integrate it in a space.

The example can be found at `<GigaSpaces root>\Examples\SpaceFilter`

This demo shows three equivalent space filter implementations, and a console application that runs the same demo sequence three times, once per filter implementation:

- [MessageCensorshipAttributeFilter](#1).
- [MessageCensorshipMethodNamesFilter](#2).
- [MessageCensorshipSpaceFilter](#3).

### Censorship Filters

This demo data object is the `Message` class. This class contains one string property `Content` that holds the content of the message. The purpose of each filter, is to log certain `Message` related operations (Take, Write), and to censor messages that contain illegal words, before entering the space. All filters extend the `MessageCensorship` class, which implements the `CensorMessage` method that contains the censorship logic. The `MessageCensorship` receives an array of illegal words, and uses that to censor a message when `CensorMessage` is called.

### Demo Sequence

The demo sequence consists of: creating the relevant Space Filter, creating a `SpaceFilterConfig` to configure the filter, starting a space with the filter integrated in it, and executing a short sequence of writing and taking Message objects into and from the space.


```csharp
// Write a simple hello message to the space - the filter will log this message to the console.
space.Write(new Message("Hello"));

// Take and print the hello message from the space - the filter will log this operation to the console.
Console.WriteLine("Took message from space: " + space.Take(new Message()).Content);

// Write a message that contains an illegal word to the space - the filter will censor this message before it reaches the space, and log this to the console.
space.Write(new Message("Hello badword"));

// Take and print the censored message from the space - the filter will log this operation to the console.
Console.WriteLine("Took message from space: " + space.Take(new Message()).Content);

Console.WriteLine("Writing an object instance (Not Message), no monitor message should appear after this line");
// This object can not be assigned into Message - the filter will not operate on this object.
space.Write(new object());
```

{{% anchor 1 %}}

### Message Censorship Attribute Filter

This filter is implemented, using an attribute to mark the filter operation methods. This filter is based on the `Attribute-based SpaceFilterOperationDelegate]`


```csharp
public class MessageCensorshipAttributeFilter : MessageCensorship, IDisposable
{
  [...]

  [OnFilterInit]
  public void Initialize()
  {
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
    Reporter.Log("MessageCensorshipAttributeFilter initialized.");
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
  }

  public void Dispose()
  {
    //If implementing IDisposable, the Dispose method will be called when the space shuts down
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
    Reporter.Log("MessageCensorshipAttributeFilter closed.");
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
  }

  [BeforeTake]
  //Only filter objects that can be assigned to Message
  public void LogTake(Message message)
  {
    Reporter.Log("Taking message from space.");
  }

  [BeforeWrite]
  public void LogAndCensorizeWrite(ISpaceFilterEntry entry)
  {
    //Only operate if the filter entry type is Message, use ObjectType to filter the relevant object types for better performance.
	if (typeof(Message).IsAssignableFrom(entry.ObjectType))
    {
      //Gets the actual message inside the entry, when calling this method only then the object is actually being evaluated.
      Message message = (Message)entry.GetObject();
      if (CensorMessage(message))
      {
        //Updates the actual message inside the filter entry, this method must be used if the value needs
        //to be updated inside the filter entry, this is done in a lazy manner.
        //
        //When it is needed to update the entry value the paramter that should be used is ISpaceFilterEntry, otherwise the value
        //will only be updated locally.
        entry.UpdateObject(message);
        Reporter.Log("Message being written to space contains bad words.");
      }
      else
        Reporter.Log("Writing message to space: " + message.Content);
    }
  }
}
```

The different attributes are used to mark which method needs to be invoked, according to the different filter operations. The parameters that the method signature contains, must be of a specific structure(`SpaceFilterOperationDelegate`.

Each space filter needs a `SpaceFilterConfig` that defines it in order to integrate in a space. The attribute-based filter uses the `AttributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory`.


```csharp
//Create an attribute based space filter delegate configurer
AttributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory attributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory = new AttributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory();
attributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory.Filter = new MessageCensorshipAttributeFilter(IllegalWords);

spaceConfig.SpaceFiltersConfig = new SpaceFilterConfig[]{attributeSpaceFilterConfigFactory.CreateSpaceFilterConfig()};

//Start a space with the configured filter
space = GigaSpacesFactory.FindSpace("/./spaceAttributeFilterDemo", spaceConfig);
```

In this example, we can see that the `LogAndCensorizeWrite` method receives an `ISpaceFilterEntry` as its single parameter, and not the `Message` object like the `LogTake` method. That's because this method might need to update the value of the message when it needs to be censored. This can only be done using the `entry.UpdateObject` method.

Another important thing to notice is that the `LogAndCensorizeWrite` method first checks if the Message type  from the `entry.ObjectType`, can be assigned into Message, and only then gets the actual Message object. This is done to decrease the performance impact of the filter, because the evaluation of `GetObject` and `UpdateObject` is done in a lazy fashion.

This filter class implements `IDisposable`, to demonstrate that when a filter class implements the `IDisposable` interface, it is disposed of when the space shuts down.

### Message Censorship Method Names Filter

This filter is implemented using method names to mark the filter operation methods. This filter is based on the `Method name-based SpaceFilterOperationDelegate`.


```csharp
public class MessageCensorshipMethodNamesFilter : MessageCensorship, IDisposable
{
  [...]

  public void Initialize()
  {
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
    Reporter.Log("MessageCensorshipAttributeFilter initialized.");
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
  }

  public void Dispose()
  {
    //If implementing IDisposable, the Dispose method will be called when the space shutdown
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
    Reporter.Log("MessageCensorshipAttributeFilter closed.");
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
  }

  //Only filter objects that can be assigned to Message
  public void LogTake(Message message)
  {
    Reporter.Log("Taking message from space.");
  }

  public void LogAndCensorizeWrite(ISpaceFilterEntry entry)
  {
    //Only operate if the filter entry type is Message, use ObjectType to filter the relevant object types for better performance.
	if (typeof(Message).IsAssignableFrom(entry.ObjectType))
    {
      //Gets the actual message inside the entry, when calling this method only then the object is actually being evaluated.
      Message message = (Message)entry.GetObject();
      if (CensorMessage(message))
      {
        //Updates the actual message inside the filter entry, this method must be used if the value needs
        //to be updated inside the filter entry, this is done in a lazy manner.
        //
        //When it is needed to update the entry value the paramter that should be used is ISpaceFilterEntry, otherwise the value
        //will only be updated locally.
        entry.UpdateObject(message);
        Reporter.Log("Message being written to space contains bad words.");
      }
      else
        Reporter.Log("Writing message to space: " + message.Content);
    }
  }
}
```

This filter implementation is very similar to the attribute-based one`, except that there are no marker attributes. The method that needs to be invoked according to the filter operation, is specified by name when creating the `MethodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory`  that creates the `SpaceFilterConfig` for this filter.


```csharp
//Create a method based space filter delegate configurer
MethodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory methodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory = new MethodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory();
methodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory.Filter = new MessageCensorshipMethodNamesFilter(IllegalWords);
methodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory.BeforeWrite = "LogAndCensorizeWrite";
methodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory.BeforeTake = "LogTake";
methodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory.OnFilterInit = "Initialize";

spaceConfig.SpaceFiltersConfig = new SpaceFilterConfig[] { methodNameSpaceFilterConfigFactory.CreateSpaceFilterConfig() };

//Start a space with the configured filter
space = GigaSpacesFactory.FindSpace("/./spaceMethodFilterDemo", spaceConfig);
```

The same structure for the filter operation method applies here as well.

{{% anchor 3 %}}

### Message Censorship Space Filter

This filter implements the `ISpaceFilter`  interface directly.


```csharp
public class MessageCensorshipSpaceFilter : MessageCensorship, ISpaceFilter
{
  [..]
  public void Dispose()
  {
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
    Reporter.Log("MessageCensorshipSpaceFilter closed.");
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
  }

  public void Init(ISpaceProxy proxy, string filterId, IDictionary<string, string> customProperties, FilterPriority priority)
  {
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
    Reporter.Log("MessageCensorshipSpaceFilter initialized.");
    Reporter.Log("--------------------------------------------");
  }

  public void Process(SecurityContext securityContext, ISpaceFilterEntry entry, FilterOperation operation)
  {
    //Only operate if the filter entry type is Message, use ObjectType to filter the relevant object types for better performance.
    if (typeof(Message).IsAssignableFrom(entry.ObjectType))
    {
      switch (operation)
      {
        case FilterOperation.BeforeTake:
          Reporter.Log("Taking message from space.");
          break;
        case FilterOperation.BeforeWrite:
          //Gets the actual message inside the entry, when calling this method only then the object is actually being evaluated.
          Message message = (Message) entry.GetObject();
          if (CensorMessage(message))
          {
            //Updates the actual message inside the filter entry, this method must be used if the value needs
            //to be updated inside the filter entry, this is done in a lazy manner.
            entry.UpdateObject(message);
            Reporter.Log("Message being written to space contains bad words.");
          }
          else
            Reporter.Log("Writing message to space: " + message.Content);
          break;
      }
    }
  }

  public void Process(SecurityContext securityContext, ISpaceFilterEntry firstEntry, ISpaceFilterEntry secondEntry, FilterOperation operation)
  {
  }
}
```

All the filter operations are represented by the operation parameter in the Process method. A switch on the operation, delegates the operation to the corresponding filtering action.

When implementing `ISpaceFilter`, a `SpaceFilterConfig` needs to be created, and each filter operation that should be filtered, needs to be specified in it.


```csharp
//Create configuration for space filter
SpaceFilterConfig spaceFilterConfig = new SpaceFilterConfig();

spaceFilterConfig.Filter = new MessageCensorshipSpaceFilter(IllegalWords);
spaceFilterConfig.FilterOperations = new FilterOperation[]{FilterOperation.BeforeWrite, FilterOperation.BeforeTake};

SpaceConfig spaceConfig = new SpaceConfig();
spaceConfig.SpaceFiltersConfig = new SpaceFilterConfig[]{spaceFilterConfig};

//Start a space with the configured filter
ISpaceProxy space = GigaSpacesFactory.FindSpace("/./spaceFilterDemo", spaceConfig);
```
