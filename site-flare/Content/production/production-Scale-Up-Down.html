        <h1>Types of Scaling</h1>
        <p>Vertical scaling, referred to as <b>On Demand Scale Up/Down</b> and the subject of this topic, allows  the amount of RAM and CPU to be increased or decreased - without downtime - for an active GigaSpaces cluster. For example, additional memory or CPUs may be added to an existing physical node.</p>
        <p>Another form of scaling, horizontal scaling, referred to as <b><a href="production-Scale-Out-In.html">On Demand Scale Out/In</a></b>, means to add or reduce the number of partitions used for an application. For example, additional partitions may be created in the same server, or alternatively, servers may be added or removed.</p>
        <p>For an overview of both types of scaling, see <MadCap:xref href="production-Rescaling-your-application-in-GigaSpaces.html">Rescaling Your Application in [%=General.CompanyName%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Advantages of On Demand Scale Up/Down</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Resources are located in close physical proximity. This allows faster access to related data, such as credit/debit table updates in a closed (atomic) unit of work..</li>
            <li>A performance gain is realized, because their is more RAM and CPU on each update.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>On Demand Scale Up/Down is supported in Kubernetes<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Version.16-0-died"> and ElasticGrid</MadCap:conditionalText>. It is not currently supported in ServiceGrid.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>If an application expects a significant increase in resource requirements at, for example, 9 am daily, the system may be scaled up -  to perhaps 20 times greater CPU capacity in the morning. Later in the day, the user will scale the system back down to its default level.</p>
        <p>Another example is Black Friday or Digital Monday, during which the system expects marked peaks of activity. Up scaling can be performed before the expected busy period, and down scaling can be done when normal activity levels resume.</p>
        <p>In this way, SLA/performance levels can be met consistently throughout the day.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Scaling is performed by the user on demand, at the time that they want to change the resource levels. Scaling can be performed either by entering a command in the command line, or by requesting the scaling in the Ops Manager.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Which Partitions to Scale Up/Down?</h2>
        <p>The option of which partitions to scale depends on the service type.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>For a Stateful service, the service must be deployed with High Availability to enable the Scale Up/Down functionality.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For a <b>Stateful</b> service - </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scale at the <b>Service level</b> - scale all of the partitions that use the service. <br />An example is a service used for a shopping cart. At certain times the user may wish to Scale Up/Down all of the partitions using the service, no matter where they are located.</li>
            <li>Scale a <b>Single partition</b>. <br />An example is a partition that handles flight requests to a particular airport. At times it may be necessary to scale the resource for that particular partition, depending on seasonal travel patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a <b>Stateless</b> service -- </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scale at the <b>Service level</b> - scale all of the partitions that use the service. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What APIs are Available for On Demand Scale Up/Down?</h2>
        <p>Scale Up/Down can be performed in each of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> interfaces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ops Manager</li>
            <li>Command Line Interface </li>
            <li>REST-API</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>When using the Command Line Interface or REST API, the user can scale a list of partitions in a single request. <br />This is in addition to the ability to scale a single partition or to scale a service, as provided in Ops Manager. </p>
        </div>
        <p>For all of these environments, two basic decisions are required: which partitions to scale, and how much to scale.</p>
        <p>Regarding which partitions, the user can request that all partitions using a particular service should be scaled, or they can choose a specific partition. </p>
        <p>Regarding the amount to scale up or down, the user chooses a value for CPUs and RAM, which will be applied to all of the partitions that are scaled.</p>
        <h2>On Demand Scale Up/Down Using the Ops Manager</h2>
        <h3>Selecting Partitions by Service</h3>
        <p>From the Service screen for the stateful service that you wish to scale, hover over the three dots on the top of the screen, and click <b>Scale up/down</b>:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In this Kubernetes example, the user chose a CPU value of 500m (millicores), and a RAM size of 600 MiB. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Version.16-0-died">Note that for ElasticGrid, these values would be expressed in MHz and Mb. </MadCap:conditionalText>Light blue values indicate the original, default values for these parameters.</p>
        <p>Click <b>Apply</b> to accept the values shown. A confirmation screen will display:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/susd-scale-entire-service.jpg" class="tc-picture30" />
        </p>
        <p>Click <b>Run Scale</b> to proceed with the scaling request, or <b>Cancel </b>to abort the request.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>We are scaling up or down on the <b>service</b> level. </p>
            <p>This means that all of the partitions using this service will be rescaled. Each of these 100 instances will be rescaled to 500m and 600 MiB.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>During the scaling process, both the original instances and the new instances will co-exist in memory. This will require a temporary increase in the total amount of system resources.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tc-admon-attention">
            <p>After you click on <b>Run Scale</b>, the scaling process will begin. At that point, it is not possible to cancel the scaling operation.</p>

        <p>The next screen shows the scaling request in progress. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-the-next-screen-shows-scaling-req.jpg" class="tc-picture90" />
        </p>
        <p>The blue banner on the top of the screen is a progress indicator with messages indicating the stage of the scaling:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-scaling-service-in-progress.jpg" class="tc-picture30" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">Note that for performance reasons, and to ensure high availability and service resilience, scaling is done in small "batches" of partitions. In this example, 100 instances are being scaled, in ten batches of ten partitions each.</p>
        <p>When scaling completes successfully, a message is displayed:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-scaling-service-completed.jpg" class="tc-picture30" />
        </p>
        <p>If an error occurs, an appropriate message will display:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-scaling-partly-completed.jpg" class="tc-picture30" />
        </p>
        <p>and the right side of the screen will show an option to display an error log:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-scaling-show-error-log.jpg" class="tc-picture25" />
        </p>
        <p>During the scale process, if the scaling of one of the partition fails (possibly caused by lack of system resources), this partition will be reverted to its previous configuration and the scale process will be stopped (the next partitions won't be scaled). <br />An error message will display, and the partitions that have already scaled, will stay scaled.<br />No data loss will occur.</p>
        <p>Once the scaling request has completed, a cube-shaped icon displays on the top right of the screen. You can hover over this icon to see a brief description of the scaling result:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-service-scaled-up-fixed.jpg" class="tc-picture30" />
        </p>
        <h3>Selecting a Specific Partition to Scale</h3>
        <p>From the Service screen for the stateful service that you wish to scale, hover over the three dots that are on the same row as the partition instance that you wish to scale, and click <b>Scale up/down</b>:</p>
        <p>Note that you can select either the primary instance of the partition or the secondary instance. Either choice will scale the same partition.</p>
        <p>The Scale Up/Down screen will display, as discussed <a href="#units_explained">above</a>:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-selecting-specific-partition-14079.bmp" class="tc-picture50" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that in this case, the particular partition number, Partition 14079, is displayed on the top of the screen.</p>
