        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Service Account Privilege Management</h1>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> already secures user accounts. This is being expanded to now include the securing of service accounts. A service account differs to a user account in that it is software that runs in our Smart Cache or Smart DIH. &#160;The service account has both internal and external applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Internal Smart DIH</b>: A deployed pipeline. SQL&#160;stream or micro-service. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>External Applications</b>: An application which wants to read from our Smart Cache or Smart DIH, for example a user who wants to write a Java application to read from our Smart Cache or Smart DIH. It does not necessarily need to be deployed on the same Kubernetes cluster.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An external IDP cannot be relied upon as they cannot manage services, only users.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> has a mechanism that will manage the service account applications mentioned above.</p>
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Internal Smart DIH</b>: Services that are created  from within our Smart Cache or Smart DIH, such as a Pipeline or a Micro-Service, will automatically be registered. &#160;A service account will be created for any new service and this will be transparent to the user.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>External Applications</b>: There is an interface through which a user can register their application as a service account so <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is aware of it.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the services are defined,  roles can be assigned to them.  From then, all the privileges management use the RBAC model which replicates what is implemented for user accounts. Due to this, it seamlessly compliments the already available security authorization management.</p>
        <h1 style="background-color: #ffff00;">How To</h1>
        <p>Please refer to our SpaceDeck documentation which explains how service accounts are created and managed.</p>

        <p>Is there a flow to edit the Service&#160;Name</p>
