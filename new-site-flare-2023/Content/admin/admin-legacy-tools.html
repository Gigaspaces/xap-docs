<h1>Legacy Topics</h1>
  <p>The topics in this section are older versions of the administration tool documentation, some of which describe tool versions that have since been updated. We encourage users to adopt these updated tools that are documented in the <a href="admin-tools.html">Administration Tools</a> section, such as the new interactive Command Line Interface that supports both <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />, and V2 of the REST Manager API that contains updated terminology.</p>
