<h1>Lease Time</h1>
  

<p>In distributed applications on a network, where there may be partial failures of the network or of components, there needs to be a way for components to be timed out if they have failed, or have become unreachable. Lease is a basic mechanism GigaSpaces provides to address this problem. GigaSpaces provides this functionality using Jini technology.</p>

<h1><a name="lease-basics"></a>Lease Basics</h1>

<p>The essential idea behind a lease is fairly simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>When creating a resource, the requestor creates the resource with a  limited life span.</li>
<li>The grantor of the resource will then give access for some period of time that is no longer than that requested.</li>
<li>The period of time that is actually granted is returned to the requestor as part of the Lease object.</li>
<li>A holder of a lease can request that a Lease be renewed, or cancel the Lease at any time.</li>
<li>Successfully renewing a lease extends the time period during which the lease is in effect.</li>
<li>Cancelling the lease drops the lease immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Few other ways Lease can be managed include,</p>

<ul>
<li>Specifying the Lease interface constant FOREVER, requests a lease that never expires. When granted such a lease, the grantor is responsible for ensuring that the leased resource is freed when no longer needed.</li>
<li>Specifying the Lease interface constant ANY, indicates that no particular lease time is desired and that the grantor of the lease should supply a time that is most convenient for the grantor. (GigaSpaces converts leases with ANY constant to FOREVER leases).</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="space-object-lease"></a>Space Object Lease</h1>

<p>Leases can be used for objects written to an <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> cluster. All the write operations in <a href="[%=Links.ApiDotNetDoc%]/T_GigaSpaces_Core_ISpaceProxy.htm">ISpaceProxy</a> interface support Lease. Lease duration is an argument that is passed to the write operations and they return a Lease Context which can be used to manage the Leases.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">MyMessage message1 = new MyMessage ();

// Writes the message with 1000 millis/1 sec Lease
ILeaseContext&lt;MyMessage&gt; lease1 = spaceProxy.Write (message1, 1000);

MyMessage message2 = new MyMessage ();

// Writes the message with Default Lease of FOREVER
ILeaseContext&lt;MyMessage&gt; lease2 = spaceProxy.Write (message2);

MyMessage message3 = new MyMessage ();

// Writes the message with Lease of FOREVER
ILeaseContext&lt;MyMessage&gt; lease3 = spaceProxy.Write (message3, long.MaxValue);
</code></pre>

<h1><a name="getting-lease-expiration-date"></a>Getting Lease Expiration Date</h1>

<p>You may use the <code>Lease.getExpiration</code> to retrieve the time where the space object will expire. See below simple example - It writes a space into the space with 10 seconds lease and later prints how much time is left for the space object to remain in space before it will expire:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">// Writing object into the space with 10 seconds lease time
ILeaseContext&lt;MyMessage&gt; lease = spaceProxy.Write(new MyMessage(),10000);
String UID = lease.Uid;

Console.Write("Current Date:"+ new DateTime() + " Lease Expiration Date:" + new DateTime(lease.Expiration));

while(true)
{
    long expiredDue = (lease.Expiration - new DateTime().Millisecond) ;

    Console.Write("Object "+UID +" Expired in :" + expiredDue+ " seconds");

    if (expiredDue &lt;= 0) break;
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
}
</code></pre>

<h1><a name="manually-managing-space-object-lease"></a>Manually Managing Space Object Lease</h1>

<p>GigaSpaces API returns the <code>ILeaseContext</code> after every write operation/update operation. Space Object Leases can be renewed or cancelled based on the application needs.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">ILeaseContext&lt;Order&gt; lease;

...
public void writeOrder() {
...
//Save lease from write operation
lease = spaceProxy.Write(singleOrder);
...

public void cancelLease() {
...
lease.Cancel();
</code></pre>

<p>Another alternative to using ILeaseContext objects is to retrieve the objects and updating the Lease to desired duration.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">//Retrieve all processed low priority orders and expire the lease
Order template = new Order();

template.Type=OrderType.LOW;
template.Processed=true;

Order[] processedLowPriorityOrders = spaceProxy.ReadMultiple(template, 1000);

//Update the lease to expire in 1 second
spaceProxy.WriteMultiple(processedLowPriorityOrders,
        1000,                   // Update the Lease to 1 second
        WriteModifiers.UpdateOrWrite); // Update existing object
</code></pre>
