<h1>Introduction</h1>
  

<p>The InsightEdge platform, a combination of the XAP in-memory data grid and an open-source analytics ecosystem, is an in-memory insight platform that supports fast-data analytics, artificial intelligence and real-time applications. Customers can use this platform to develop their own systems that provide instant data-driven insights with time-to-analytics at a sub-second scale, and the ability to hyperscale analytics from SQL, streaming to machine learning via Apache Spark.</p>

<p>The InsightEdge platform provides extreme performance with ultra-low latency, high-throughput transactions and stream processing, due to the co-location of applications and analytics. All of this functionality is available in a cloud-native, infrastructure-agnostic deployment for hybrid cloud and on-premises environments.</p>

<p>InsightEdge Enterprise offers the following additional benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Multi-tiered data storage across RAM, SSD, and Storage-Class Memory (3DXPoint)</p></li>

<li><p>High availability (up to 5 nines) with auto-healing</p></li>

<li><p>Disaster recovery via geo-redundancy, fast data replication and native persistence</p></li>
</ul>
