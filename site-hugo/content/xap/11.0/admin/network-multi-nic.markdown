XAP can be configured for a multiple network-card environment. For security reasons, network administrators may choose to configure their network with limited access of one card open to outside connections, and another card for internal connections. The default network card configuration is not always set to the network card used for internal connection, and thus needs to be configured.

The `java.rmi.server.hostname` system property is used to resolve the NIC address for all services, which bind to a specific network interface, e.g. Jini unicast discovery lookup host, Webster, etc. More specifically, multicast and unicast discovery both use this property to limit and set the desired network interface card.

The `XAP_NIC_ADDRESS` environment variable is exposed as part of the `<XAP Root>\bin\setenv` script. By default, this value is configured to use the hostname of the machine.

Since the `java.rmi.server.hostname` system property is set by default to the `XAP_NIC_ADDRESS` environment variable, and propagated across all product components/layers; in most cases, you don't need to edit the `setenv` file or any other configuration file.

To apply this configuration easily, the `XAP_NIC_ADDRESS` variable can be passed at the **script level** of each node startup, before the call to `setenv`, thus overriding the default value set for this property in the `setenv` script.

Make sure your network and machines running XAP are configured to have multicast enabled. See the [Multicast Configuration](./network-multicast.html) section for details on how to enable multicast.
