The XAP.NET installer enables developers to start evaluating and using the product immediately in an initial setup, without any manual configuration changes required to see how the product works. However, in order to set up a properly functioning system that meets your organizational needs, you may have to customize the following:


- [System ](./system-configuration.html) - There are a number of system properties that can be configured via the application configuration file, and the base configuration files.
- [Platform ](./system-configuration-list.html) - You can modify the platform configuration properties for the XAP.NET grid environment.
- [JVM](./jvm-configuration.html) - While the default runtime settings are generally sufficient when developing your XAP.NET based application, when performing testing and preparing for production, you may have to modify the JVM settings to fine-tune performance.
- [Logging](./log-configuration.html) - To effectively perform administration and maintenance on your .NET client application, you can customize the tracing mechanism that comes built in with the .NET framework to improve the logging.
