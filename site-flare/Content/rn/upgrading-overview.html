        <h1>Recommended Upgrade Steps</h1>
        <p>Follow this suggested upgrade procedure for performing a regular upgrade:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First try to compile minimal code with the current maven artifacts (comment out hibernate &amp; jetty integrations). Go to : <a href="../started/installation-maven-overview.html">Maven Doc.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Change PU xmls and remove version so version will be taken automatically from gs version running the PU. e.g., copy from blueprint.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Change variables: <a href="../started/common-environment-variables.html">Env Variables</a> in <code class="language-bash">setenv-overrides</code> script if needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the manager was not used before use the gs-agent script to start the grid similar to the way it was done for the previous version.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fix the hibernate PUs to use the latest hibernate version.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fix web-PUs to use the current version of  jetty, After all PUs are updated and all the code compiles try to deploy all PUs. Remember that the default service limit is 1 and start the GSCs accordingly (or change the default which is not recommended).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Deploy the applications manually.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Run your tests to validate behaviour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Move to use xap-manager instead of the deprecated gs-agent script, if you did not use xap-manager previously - see <a href="../admin/xap-manager.html">Manager Doc.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fix scripts to use the new CLI or new Rest API.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add new features to improve performance and reduce memory footprint and monitoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Retest and validate behaviour.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Hot Upgrade Overview</h1>
        <p>Hot Upgrade is required in order to perform changes without downtime, allowing the application users to keep working,</p>
        <p>If there is no change in replication mechanism. GigaSpaces version hot upgrade is possible.</p>
        <p>In order to upgrade to a new <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />version without downtime, we have to allow a cluster with both new and old version to run simultaneously.</p>
        <p>The hot upgrade feature is guaranteed only in the case of upgrading from the same major version, (e.g upgrade from 16.3 to 16.3.1 )</p>
        <p>It is not guaranteed in case of different major versions.</p>
