                <h1>Introducing SpaceDeck</h1>
                <p><a href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-overview.html">SpaceDeck</a>, GigaSpaces new User Interface, is now fully available for use in our Smart DIH&#160;product via <a href="../admin/DIH-installation-kubernetes.html">Kubernetes installation</a>. </p>
                <p>SpaceDeck is an intuitive, streamlined user interface to manage and control the GigaSpaces environment.</p>
                <p>Using SpaceDeck, you can define the tools to bring legacy System of Record (SoR) databases into the in-memory data grid that is the core of the GigaSpaces system.</p>
                <div class="tc-admon-note">
                    <p>&#160;For Smart DIH SpaceDeck does not yet cover all functionality. Our  <a href="../admin/gs-ops-manager-overview.html">Ops Manager UI</a> is still used to manage <a href="platform-feature-access.html">certain functionality</a>. SpaceDeck is initially available for SmartDIH installations on Kubernetes, and will be extended in future releases to eventually replace the older UIs.</p>
                </div>

                    <h1>Service Creator</h1>
                    <p>Low code development of data micro-services provide our clients with the ability to deploy and execute data services efficiently. &#160;This assumes that the micro-service runs a query on the space data. It enables the user to define a REST endpoint that, per request, will run the predefined query using the supplied required parameters to get the results. This is easily achievable via our&#160;SpaceDeck UI. For more information see the SpaceDeck <a href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-services.html">Services</a> page.</p>

                <h1>Data Integration (DI) Layer </h1>
                <p>Introducing the <MadCap:xref href="../landing-pages/AO-DataIntegration.htm">Data Integration (DI)</MadCap:xref> layer, which is a vital part of the Digital Integration Hub (DIH) platform. DI is the gateway for incoming data into the Data Integration Hub (DIH) system. This is deployed via Kubernetes only. The DI components are delivered as part of the GigaSpaces DIH Package. DI contains four components which are responsible for reading and analyzing Kafka messages and for pushing them into the Space. DI is responsible for a wide range of data integration tasks as ingesting data in batches or streaming data changes. DI integrates with  Oracle and MSSQL databases. It also contains the  IBM Infosphere Data Replication (IIDR) which is a connector engine for data pipelines.</p>

                <h1>SQL Over&#160;Nested Objects Search</h1>
                <p>Our <a href="../dev-java/sql-supported-syntax.html">JDBC V3</a> now allows <a href="../dev-java/nested-objects-search.html">querying complex objects</a> (hierarchical objects) using our standard extended SQL. This extended SQL lets the user refer to document or POJO fields in different levels of hierarchy, within arrays and Java collections, from a standard SQL query.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Smart DIH&#160;Installation via Kubernetes</h1>
                <p>GigaSpaces Smart DIH can now be easily installed on a Kubernetes cluster. Smart DIH is built as a Kubernetes native platform which leverages Kubernetes strengths such as scalability, smart orchestration, easy cloud deployment. All three layers of SmartDIH - from the DI (Data Integration), through to the in-memory data grid (IMDG), and the data services - are built as multi-pod platforms that allow native Kubernetes installation, orchestration and scale. The full Smart DIH package is delivered as one Kubernetes Umbrella that can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster.</p>
