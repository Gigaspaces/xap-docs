When you first start working with InsightEdge or XAP, you may want to deploy a sample Space or Processing Unit in order to begin working with components and understanding how they behave and interact. Further along in the development cycle, or when moving to production, you may have to explore the environment in greater detail to perform fine-tuning of the system, or revise the cluster topology for better data management and performance. You can use the available administration tools to do the following:

- Deploy Spaces and Processing Units
- View runtime and configuration information for various XAP components
- View data and operational statistics
- View network and transaction details
- Perform advanced maintenance activities such as querying the data in the Space, taking a Processing Unit down for maintenance (quiescing), or relocating a Processing Unit
