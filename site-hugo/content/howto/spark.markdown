{{%exurl "Apache Spark""https://spark.apache.org/"%}} is a powerful open-source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics, with APIs in Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL. 
Spark runs programs up to 100x faster than Apache Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk.
It can be used to build data applications as a library, or to perform ad-hoc data analysis interactively.


Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL, DataFrames, and Datasets, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming. You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.
As well, Spark runs on a laptop, Apache Hadoop, Apache Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources including HDFS, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, and S3.
