This troubleshooting section provides a comprehensive list of [common user Issues](./troubleshooting-common-user-issues.html) that may occur while developing and deploying XAP-based user applciations, along with troubleshooting methodology, possible causes, and what information to collect if you have to consult with GigaSpaces support.

This section also provides [guidelines](./troubleshooting-protective-modes.html) for building highly robust and efficient applications, with instructions on how to avoid common mistakes.

However, if you encounter problems that require troublshooting, the following may be helpful:

- Verifying your local or remote installation by [testing the system environment](./troubleshooting-testing-system-environment.html).
- [Viewing the clustered Space status](./troubleshooting-viewing-clustered-space-status.html) using different logging levels.
- Configuring the [Failure Detection](./troubleshooting-failure-detection.html)parameters more accurately to reduce the failure detection time and avoid the need for failover.

A list of recommended [troubleshooting tools](./troubleshooting-tools.html) is also provided, which can be used for testing a running product and identifying environmental issues.
