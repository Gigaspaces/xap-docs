        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Getting Started with MemoryXtend</h1>
        <p> In a traditional deployment, all data grid entries are stored in RAM to provide the fastest performance possible. However, while RAM performs better than SSD, it is also more expensive. As SSD gains in popularity, we see new scenarios where storing part of the data in SSD and part in RAM provides great business value. It provides the ability to scale the amount of data you store and handle with a relative small footprint in a cost effective manner, while maintaining high performance where the indexes are always stored in RAM. The MemoryXtend (blobstore) storage model allows an external storage medium (one that does not reside on the JVM heap) to store the Space data.</p>
        <p>This topic demonstrates  how to implement tiered storage by adding MemoryXtend to a data grid, in order to store part of the data in SSD. For additional information please refer to the <a href="../admin/memoryxtend-overview.html">MemoryXtend</a> topic.</p>
        <h1>Adding Tiered Storage to the Data Grid</h1>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>For instructions on how to deploy the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIEP" />, see <a href="insightedge-in-5-minutes.html">InsightEdge in 5 Minutes</a>. </p>
        </div>
        <p>In this deployment, we utilize the available RAM storage to store the most time sensitive (hot) data, and store the less time sensitive (warm) data in SSD. The example uses 3 data types 0, 1 and 2. Data types 0 and 2 are the warm data and should be stored in SSD (which is persistent, and therefore the warm data remains available after the processing unit is redeployed). Data type 1 is the hot data and therefore stored in RAM for faster access.</p>
        <p>We deploy a project that has two services (pu.xml files), a feeder that feeds data into the data grid, and a processor service that is responsible to store the data received from the feeder in the correct place. Without the MemoryXtend feature to facilitate tiered storage, all the data resides on RAM. When MemoryXtend is added to the data grid, we can define hot and warm data and where each is stored.</p>
        <p>To add MemoryXtend to the data grid modify the processor pu.xml  to include the MemoryXtend blobstore, which allows an external storage medium to store the data. In <span class="tc-italic">&lt;project path&gt;/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/pu.xml</span>, do the following:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Add these entries to define the SSD blobstore in the <code>&lt;beans&gt;</code> element:</p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-java">xmlns:blob-store="http://www.openspaces.org/schema/rocksdb-blob-store" </code></pre><pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-java">http://www.openspaces.org/schema/rocksdb-blob-store http://www.openspaces.org/schema/14.0/rocksdb-blob-store/openspaces-rocksdb-blobstore.xsd</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the blobstore that includes 4 instances with mapping directory to these paths:</p><pre><code class="language-java">&lt;blob-store:rocksdb-blob-store id="rocksDbBlobstore" paths="[/tmp/memory-xtend-demo/db1,/tmp/memory-xtend-demo/db2,/tmp/memory-xtend-demo/db3,/tmp/memory-xtend-demo/db4]" mapping-dir="/tmp/memory-xtend-demo/mapping"/&gt;</code></pre>
                    <li>
                        <p>Modify the Space definition to include the blobstore so it stores data persistently in the SSD layer, and define that data type 1 is stored in RAM.</p><pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;os-core:space id="space" url="/./space"&gt;
    &lt;os-core:blob-store-data-policy persistent="true" blob-store-handler="rocksDbBlobstore"&gt;
        &lt;os-core:blob-store-cache-query class="com.gigaspaces.demo.common.Data" where="type = 1"/&gt;
    &lt;/os-core:blob-store-data-policy&gt;
&lt;/os-core:space&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h1>Verifying the Extended Memory</h1>
        <p>After you configure the tiered storage for your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> deployment, you should verify that the extended memory has been deployed correctly. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow"><span class="tc-highlight">Since data type 1 continues to be stored in RAM (see my addition to the editorial note below)</span>, is fetched from SSD layer.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Build the project again.<br /></li>
            <li>
                <p>Deploy the processing unit again and run the query in the Web Management Console:</p><pre>select UID, * from com.gigaspaces.demo.common.Data</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <p>Since data was stored persistently in SSD, all data types are fetched.</p>
            <p style="color: #ff0000;" MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">ED NOTE: The recording from Alex has additional round of undeploy/deploy  but results/purpose are not clear, so omitted (for now) - The main point of demo has already been achieved without these steps, <span class="tc-highlight">Missing the explanation of how we test to make sure MemoryXtend was deployed correctly and works properly before the actual procedure. What is the query supposed to retrieve? if we redeployed the processing unit then will data type 1 be missing, since it wasn't read to the persistent memory? Also, where are the results of the test? Should there be a screen capture to show what it looks like? </span></p>
        </ol>
        <h1>Additional MemoryXtend Drivers</h1>
        <p>MemoryXtend supports the following additional storage options for tiered storage, which can be used alone or together with the SSD driver:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../admin/memoryxtend-pmem.html">Persistent Memory</a> (PMEM) - provides performance similar to RAM, but at a cost closer to that of SSD.</li>
            <li><a href="../admin/memoryxtend-ohr.html#https://docs.gigaspaces.com/14.5/admin/memoryxtend-ohr.html">Off-Heap RAM </a>- stores Space objects in RAM outside the Java heap, which provides better RAM utilization.</li>
        </ul>
