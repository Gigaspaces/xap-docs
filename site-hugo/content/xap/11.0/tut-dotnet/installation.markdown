Throughout this tutorial we will create and use a simple internet payment service application to demonstrate the basic XAP features.

{{%column width="80%" %}}
The basic concept of our application;

- Merchants enter into a contract to handle financial transactions using the application.
- The Merchant will receive a percentage for each transaction.
- Users will make payments with the online system.

You can download all examples presented here from {{%git "https://github.com/Gigaspaces/xapnet-tutorial"%}}. Feel free to clone, fork and contribute to the tutorial code.


{{%vbar "Download and Install XAP"%}}
XAP.NET is packaged as a standard Windows Installer package (.msi file). You can download {{%download "http://www.gigaspaces.com/xap-download"%}} the latest version.
{{%/vbar%}}

Once you have downloaded the distribution, start the installation by double-clicking the msi file and the installation wizard will appear and guide you through the installation process.

The default product location is **C:\GigaSpaces\XAP.NET \{Version\} \{Platform\}** (For example: C:\{{%version "gshome-net-directory"%}}). This convention supports side-by-side installation of different versions and platforms (x86, x64) of XAP.NET.

The product directory structure as follows:

    - **Bin** -- Contains binaries (Executables and dll files) of the product.
        - **GigaSpaces.Core.dll** -- Main XAP.NET library. All XAP.NET applications reference this assembly.
        - **Gs-Agent.exe** - Starts a local [Service Grid Agent]({{%currentadmurl%}}/the-runtime-environment.html).
        - **Gs-cli.exe** -- Command Line Interface for XAP administration.

        - **Gs-ui.exe** -- Standalone [Management Center]({{%currentadmurl%}}/gigaspaces-management-center.html).
        - **ServicesManager.exe** - [GigaSpaces Services Manager]({{%currentneturl%}}/gigaspaces-services-manager.html).
    - **Config** -- Contains configuration files.
        - **Settings.xml** - Main product settings file.
    - **Deploy** -- Default location of Processing Units for Service Grid.
