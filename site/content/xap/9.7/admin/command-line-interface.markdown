#### Troubleshooting: terminated services are still listed

The `list` command uses the lookup service to extract the information regarding the services.

A service's entry in the lookup is leased and kept until the next renewal attempt fails. If the service is not properly shutdown, i.e. abruptly terminated, it doesn't un register itself from the lookup service. Thus, attempts to call `list` will still display the service until its lease expires.

For defaults and configuration options, refer to [Jini Lookup Service configuration]({{%currentadmurl%}}/network-lookup-service-configuration.html) settings for `minMaxServiceLease` property.


# login

#### Syntax

    gs> login
    gs> login -user xxx -password yyy

#### Description

{{% refer %}}[Command Line Interface (CLI) Security]({{%currentjavaurl%}}/command-line-interface-cli-security.html){{% /refer %}}
This CLI command allows you to login to secured services: GSM, GSC and spaces.
Each time you invoke this command, you are required afterwards to type in the user name and password (if not supplied in the command). The user name and password are used in order to attempt to authenticate secured services before invoking any operation for them ( e.g. pudeploy, undeploy, space clear, space connections ... ).

# ls

#### Syntax

    gs> ls [-l]

#### Description

The `ls` command lists the contents of the current working directory, like the Unix `ls` command.

#### Options


| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `-l` | List the contents in more detail. |


# pwd

#### Syntax

    gs> pwd

#### Description

The `pwd` command displays the full path of the current working directory, like the Unix `pwd` command.

#### Options

None.


# quit

#### Syntax

    gs> quit

#### Description

The `quit` command ends the CLI session.

{{% tip %}}
A shortcut for this command is `q`.
{{% /tip %}}

#### Options

None.

# set

#### Syntax

    gs> set [variable [value]]

#### Description

The `set` command sets the Service Grid system environment variables.

#### Options


| Option | Description | Value Format |
|:-------|:------------|:-------------|
| `groups` | The Jini lookup groups value. The group filters the specific group of services that should be managed by the current shell context. | * List of comma-delimited names: `group1,group2,...`{{<wbr>}}    - `all_groups` assigns the current context to all available GridService elements in the network. |
| `locators` | A list of Jini locators hosts. The locators provide an alternate discovery mechanism, if multicast is not working. The locator points to the location of Jini lookup hosts. Normally a lookup service is running as an embedded instance with the Grid Service Monitor (GSM). | `jini://<hostname1>`{{<wbr>}}    To set several locators you have to execute:{{<wbr>}}    `set locators jini://<hostname1>`{{<wbr>}}    `set locators jini://<hostname2>`{{<wbr>}}    ...{{<wbr>}}    To empty the locators variable you have to execute:{{<wbr>}}
`set locators null` |
| `system-props` | Should be one of the properties used by the system. Omit this parameter to view a list of the available properties. | `<system property name>=<property value>` |
| `disco-timeout` | Jini discovery timeout \[in ms\]. Defines the time for waiting for service discovery announcements. Relevant for multicast discovery only. | |
| `wait-on-deploy` | Timeout \[in ms\] for finding deployable servers. | |
| `deploy-timeout` | Timeout \[in ms\] for blocking for deployment status. |

{{% tip %}}
Make sure your network and machines running GigaSpaces are configured to have multicast enabled.
See the [How to Configure Multicast]({{%currentadmurl%}}/network-multicast.html) section for details on how to enable multicast.
