Spring Security is one of the most mature and widely used Spring projects. This section provides a short introduction to [Spring Security](./introducing-spring-security.html), and describes the GigaSpaces [Spring-based security bridge](./gigaspaces-spring-based-security-bridge.html), which leverages our [custom security](./custom-security.html) support. The implementation class `org.openspaces.security.spring.SpringSecurityManager` is open source as part of the **OpenSpaces** distribution.

This section also discusses two of the most commonly used authentication providers, [database-oriented authentication](./authenticating-against-a-database.html) and [Lightweight Data Access Protocol (LDAP)](./authenticating-against-an-ldap-repository.html). For each option, we provide a Spring XML security configuration, and explain how GigaSpaces-granted authorities should be stored.
