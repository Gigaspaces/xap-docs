Security comprises two major operations: **authentication** and **authorization**.

**Authentication** is the process of establishing and confirming the authenticity of a _principal_. A _principal_ in XAP terms, means a user (human or software) performing an action in your application.

**Authorization** refers to the process of deciding whether a principal is allowed to perform this action. The flow means that a principal is first established by the authentication process, and then authorized by the authorization decision process, when performing actions. These concepts are common and not specific to XAP Security.

At the authentication level, XAP Security is equipped with standard encryption algorithms (such as AES and MD5), which can be easily configured and replaced. The authentication layer is provided with a default implementation, which can be customized to integrate with other security standards (i.e. Spring Security). This layer is also known as the **authentication manager**.
The authentication layer is totally independent from the authorization decision layer. The **authorization decision manager** is internal to XAP components, and is used to intercept unauthorized access/operations to data and services.

XAP Security architecture has been designed to meet the needs of enterprise application security. We have tried to provide a complete experience throughout all the components, for a useful, configurable and extendable security system.
