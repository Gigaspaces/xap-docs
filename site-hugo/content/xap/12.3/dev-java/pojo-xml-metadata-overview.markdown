XAP provides the gs.xml Space mapping configuration file so you can define Space [class metadata](./pojo-xml-metadata-class.html) when using a POJO class with getter or setter methods. Space mapping files are also required when using POJO objects with the ExternalDataSource interface. The gs.xml configuration file is loaded when the application and Space are started. 

The gs.xml files can be edited to include GigaSpaces specific attributes ([property metadata](./pojo-xml-metadata-attribute.html)).
