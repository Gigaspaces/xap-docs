[Space Synchronization Endpoint API](./space-synchronization-endpoint-api.html){{<wbr>}}
The space synchronization endpoint API is used for synchronizing data from the space to an external application or a data base.

[Initial Load](./space-persistency-initial-load.html){{<wbr>}}
Space data source initial Load pre-loads the space with data before it is available for clients.

[Asynchronous Persistence](./asynchronous-persistency-with-the-mirror.html){{<wbr>}}
