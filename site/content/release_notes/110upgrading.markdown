This page contains information about changes in this release which can affect upgrading from previous versions.

In previous versions environment variable names were inconsistent, which occasionally led to confusion. Starting with XAP 11.0, all XAP related environment variables have been renamed to have a `XAP_` prefix, so they're easier to identify.
