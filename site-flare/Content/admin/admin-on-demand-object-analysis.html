        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">On Demand Object Analysis</h1>
        <p><span class="tc-bold">By performing an Object Analysis, you can determine the memory footprint of object types, properties and indexes running in one or more partitions. Two or more Object Analyses can be compared, to spot trends of increasing or decreasing memory consumption.</span>
        </p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Although  Object Analysis results are a close approximation of memory usage, some variations may exist between the reported results and the exact amount of memory used. </p>
        </div>
        <h1>How Do I Perform an Object Analysis?</h1>
        <div title="GigaSpaces Ops Manager" style="padding:10px">
            <p>An Object Analysis is triggered by pressing the <b>xxx</b> button on the Ops Manager <b>xxx </b>screen, and choosing which partition to analyze. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 18pt;font-weight: bold;">&lt;&lt;&lt; screen shot here &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
            <div class="tc-admon-attention">
                <p>Because the Object analysis process may consume considerable system resources, it is recommended to run the analysis at an off-peak time, when the system is experiencing relatively low usage.</p>
            </div>
            <h1>While the Object Analysis is Processing...</h1>
            <p>During the analysis process, the screen appears as follows:</p>

            <h1>Results of Object Analysis</h1>
            <p>When the analysis is complete, press the Reports tab on the Ops Manager Space Details screen to view the memory usage of the Spaces, Objects, Properties and Indexes.</p>
            <h2>Space Analysis</h2>
            <p>In the Space Details screen, two Data Distribution charts are displayed -- Entries by Partition, and Reads by Partition.</p>
            <h3>Entries by Partition Chart</h3>
            <h3>Reads by Partition chart</h3>
            <h2>Object Types Analysis</h2>
            <p>The Object Types analysis includes entries, RAM size, Disk Utilization, and other data for each object in the space.</p>
            <h2>Properties analysis</h2>
            <p>The Properties analysis shows ....</p>
            <h2>Indexes Analysis</h2>
            <p>The indexes analysis shows ....</p>
