            <h1>Recommended Upgrade Steps</h1>
            <p>Follow this suggested upgrade procedure for performing a regular upgrade:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>First try to compile minimal code with the current maven artifacts (comment out hibernate &amp; jetty integrations). Go to : <a href="../started/installation-maven-overview.html">Maven Doc.</a></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Change PU xmls and remove version so version will be taken automatically from gs version running the PU. e.g., copy from blueprint.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Change variables: <a href="../started/common-environment-variables.html">Env Variables</a> in <code class="language-bash">setenv-overrides</code> script if needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If the manager was not used before use the gs-agent script to start the grid similar to the way it was done for the previous version.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fix the hibernate PUs to use the latest hibernate version.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fix web-PUs to use the current version of  jetty, After all PUs are updated and all the code compiles try to deploy all PUs. Remember that the default service limit is 1 and start the GSCs accordingly (or change the default which is not recommended).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Deploy the applications manually.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Run your tests to validate behaviour.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Move to use xap-manager instead of the deprecated gs-agent script, if you did not use xap-manager previously - see <a href="../admin/xap-manager.html">Manager Doc.</a></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fix scripts to use the new CLI or new Rest API.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add new features to improve performance and reduce memory footprint and monitoring.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Retest and validate behaviour.</p>

            <h1>Flush Redolog to Disk Upon System Shutdown</h1>
            <div class="tc-admon-note">
                <p>This is only relevant when the redolog swap type is SQLite.</p>
            </div>
            <p>When a Space needs to be undeployed or when there is a system shutdown while the redolog is <b>not</b> empty, the system will try to replicate to the targets. However, if the target is not available, or after timeout, the system will continue in shutdown.</p>
            <p>In order to avoid loss of data, an option has been added to flush the memory portion onto the disk and also notify the application that the Space was shutdown with redolog.</p>
            <p>In order to enable this feature <code>com.gs.redolog.flush.on.shutdown</code> should be set to true</p>
            <h2>Implement Notification Interface</h2>
            <p><code>com.gigaspaces.utils.RedologFlushNotifier</code> - in this method you will get the fullspacename including container, Space name, the redolog size, and the path to where this redolog is stored. This will enable the file to be saved to a safe place in order to use it to recover from if required. </p>
            <p>After implementing the interface <code>set:com.gs.redolog.flush.notify.class</code> with the related class name, and place the jar containing it under <i>gs-home/platform/ext</i></p>
            <h2>Shutdown Hook Timeout</h2>
            <p>In order to allow enough time for shutdown to perform the above actions, the shutdown hook timeout should be increased. The default is 10 seconds. The parameter to be updated is <code>com.gs.shutdownhook.timeout</code> (defined in seconds).</p>
            <h3>Example </h3>
            <p>A full example, including recovery steps can be found here in <a href="https://github.com/GigaSpaces-ProfessionalServices/xap-persist-training/tree/37c8a[…]f42058910c2ea034a010ba6f6105c/xap-persist-training-lab9-redolog">Git</a>. </p>
            <p>Shutdown will be called in the case of undeploy. In the case of GSC termination or an explicit agent shutdown, it will be triggered by the shutdown hook.</p>
            <p><code>com.gs.redolog.flush.on.shutdown</code> should be set to true to flush the redolog to disk.</p>
            <p><code>com.gs.shutdownhook.timeout</code> - the default is set to 10 seconds. &#160;This can be increased to allow the shutdown process enough time to perform the flush.</p>
            <h1>BigDecimal</h1>
            <p><code>com.gs.strip-trailing-zeros</code> </p>
            <p>By default this is set to true which means the trailing zeros of big decimals are being dropped. &#160;To change this, it needs to be set explicitly to false in both the client and server.</p>

            <h1>Hot Upgrade Overview</h1>
            <p>Hot Upgrade is required in order to perform changes without downtime, allowing the application users to keep working,</p>
            <p>If there is no change in replication mechanism. GigaSpaces version hot upgrade is possible.</p>
            <p>In order to upgrade to a new <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />version without downtime, we have to allow a cluster with both new and old version to run simultaneously.</p>
            <p>The hot upgrade feature is guaranteed only in the case of upgrading from the same major version, (e.g upgrade from 16.3 to 16.3.1 )</p>
            <p>It is not guaranteed in case of different major versions.</p>
