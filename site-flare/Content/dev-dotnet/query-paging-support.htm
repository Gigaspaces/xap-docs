<h1>Paging Support</h1>
  

<p>In some scenarios there's a need to return a collection of entries from the space. This is usually carried out using one of the <a href="[%=Links.ApiJavaDoc%]/org/openspaces/core/GigaSpace.htm#readMultiple-T-">readMultiple</a> overloads in <code>GigaSpace</code>. However, if there are lots of matching entries, you may encounter several problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Memory usage - Both the server and client need to allocate enough memory for the entire result set.</li>
<li>Latency - Since all the results are returned in one bulk, the client must wait until the final result arrives before it can process the first one.</li>
</ul>

<p>A better approach is to create an iterator that iterates over the matching entries one at a time. Under the hood, the server returns results in batches, and when the client's buffer is exhausted the next batch is implicitly returned from the server.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  <p class="tc-admon-title">GSIterator</p>
  <p>This page describes the new space iterator which is intended to replace the old <code>GSIterator</code> starting 10.2. Information about the old GSIterator is available <a href="query-paging-support-old.htm">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<h1><a name="usage">&#160;</a>Usage</h1>

<p>Use the <code>GetSpaceIterator(template)</code> to create the iterator. Example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">    // Find and print all persons who are older than 21:
    foreach (var person in spaceProxy.GetSpaceIterator&lt;Person&gt;(new SqlQuery&lt;Person&gt;("Age &gt; 21")))
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Id: " + person.Id + ", Age: " + person.Age);
    }
</code></pre>

<h2><a name="transactions">&#160;</a>Transactions</h2>

<p>Iterating through the matched set does not lock the object. Objects that are under transaction and match the specified template will not be included as part of the matched set.</p>

<h3><a name="complex-queries">&#160;</a>Complex queries</h3>

<p>The space iterator only supports simple SQL queries. For more information about the differences between simple and complex queries see <a href="query-sql.htm#SimpleQueries">simple SQL queries</a>.</p>
