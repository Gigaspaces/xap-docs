        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Orchestration</h1>
        <p> <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> provides several orchestration options so that you can deploy <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> wherever it suits your needs; locally, on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standalone -  a simple cluster manager that makes it easy to set up a cluster.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.16-0-died">ElasticGrid  - Supports public cloud, on-premise  or hybrid environments and automates deploying, scaling, and managing virtualized and containerized applications.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.16-0-born">Kubernetes-  the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> implementation of the Kubernetes open-source system that automates deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.</li>

            <li>ServiceGrid - on-premise orchestration for deploying and managing virtualized applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Standalone Mode</h1>
        <p>This is a simple cluster manager that creates a cluster on your local machine. Use standalone mode to evaluate <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> products, or during development and testing.</p>
        <div MadCap:conditions="Version.16-0-died">
            <h1 MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">ElasticGrid</h1>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born"> ElasticGrid is <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />' orchestration option for cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environments that provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of virtualized and containerized applications. Public and private environments are scalable, reliable, and highly available, as well as highly cost effective. You can use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> in any environment, enabling you to easily test and deploy your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />-based applications.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">ElasticGrid has the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Ability to run containers and virtualized applications on the same infrastructure</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Automatic handling of application and node failure due to its distributed and resilient architecture</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Multi-region federation that enables linking multiple clusters</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Scalability for changing workload requirements</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h1>Kubernetes</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> products <MadCap:xref href="kubernetes-deploying-and-managing-gigaspaces.html" class="can-be-deployed-in-kubernetes">can be deployed in Kubernetes</MadCap:xref>. Kubernetes can be used in any type of environment (on-premise, cloud, or hybrid) and is supported by every major cloud provider, including public cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GCP. </p>
        <p>Benefits of using Kubernetes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to deploy <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />-based applications in whatever environment best suits the business needs of the enterprise.</li>
            <li>Kubernetes synergizes with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> products, simplifying the operationalizing of machine learning and transactional processing at scale.</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> utilizes key features of Kubernetes, such as cloud-native orchestration automation with self-healing, cooperative multi-tenancy, and RBAC authorization.</li>
            <li>Auto-deployment of data services and deep learning and machine learning frameworks, such as Apache Spark jobs, stateful services (Processing Units), as well as the Apache Zeppelin web notebook.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Service Grid</h1>
        <p>The service grid is an on-premise system for deploying and managing virtualized applications. This orchestration method is responsible for materializing the configuration of the Processing Units, provisioning the instances to the runtime infrastructure, and making sure they continue to run properly over time. Core components of the Service Grid include the Grid Service Manager, Grid Service Agent, and the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> Manager.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-died">Docker</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-died"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> products can be deployed on the Service Grid using Docker images that are available online through Docker Hub. Using Docker simplifies environment setup on-premise as well as moving to the cloud, because all the major cloud vendors support Docker. The following Docker images are available on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gigaspaces/">Docker Hub</a> (each Docker image provides instructions on how to use it):</p>
        <ul>

        <h1 MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Orchestration Option Comparison</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">You can compare the following parameters between the orchestration options, in order to determine which one best suits your needs:</p>
        <ul MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Zero configuration required - Can you deploy and run <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> on demand, or easily on existing machines?</li>

Can you evaluate the effect of your upgrade and of application changes?</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Supported environments - Can your cluster run across regions and multi-cloud providers?</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Supported apps - What type of applications are supported (container or virtualized process)?</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Version.15-2-born">Troubleshooting - Can you monitor your system, get alerts, and obtain and analyze tracing and centralized logging for your system and applications?</li>
