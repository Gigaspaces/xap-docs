        <h1>Custom Security</h1>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>This section assumes that you are familiar with <a href="security-concepts.html">basic security concepts</a>, and with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />-specific <a href="security-configurations.html">security configurations</a>. Before implementing custom security from scratch, consider the following alternatives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extending the <a href="default-file-based-security-implementation-ext.html">default file-based security implementation</a> that is already provided with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />, which supports replacing the encoding, referencing a security file on an HTTP server, and more.</li>
                <li>Using or extending the <a href="spring-security-bridge.html">Spring Security Bridge</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>GigaSpaces security was designed with customization in mind. There are numerous security standards and practices, so users can implement the built-in security features out of the box, or customize them to suit the needs of the industry and environment.</p>
        <p>You can customize the security protocols for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="custom-authentication.html">Authentication</a> - How servers authenticate the clients that access them.</li>
            <li><a href="custom-user-role-management.html">User/Role Management</a> - Creation and management of users and roles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><a name="packaging-and-classpath"></a>Packaging and Classpath</h1>
        <p>The most common scenario is for all services to share the <span class="tc-bold">same</span> custom security. This is easily accomplished by placing the custom implementation classes in the <code>lib/optional/security</code> directory.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>You can use a different directory by configuring the <code>com.gigaspaces.lib.opt.security</code> system property.</p>
        </div><pre><code class="language-java"><MadCap:variable name="General.HomePath" />/lib/optional/security/my-custom-security.jar
</code></pre>
        <p>Processing Units can share a custom security implementation that may differ from that of the GSM and GSCs. In this case, the custom security JAR can be placed under <code>pu-common</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-java"><MadCap:variable name="General.HomePath" />/lib/optional/pu-common/my-pu-custom-security.jar
</code></pre>
        <p>If each Processing Unit has its <span class="tc-bold">own</span> custom security implementation, the custom security JAR can be part of the Processing Unit distribution.</p><pre><code class="language-java"><MadCap:variable name="General.HomePath" />/deploy/hello-processor/lib/my-processor-custom-security.jar
</code></pre>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>We recommend that the custom security JAR contain only security-related classes.</p>
