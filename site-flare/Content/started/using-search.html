        <h1>Tips and Best Practices For Leveraging Search</h1>
        <p>Find the right content with ease! Building a good customer experience does not happen by accident, it happens by design. With this principle in mind, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> have taken proactive steps to upgrade our search capabilities, ensuring seamless access to the information you need.</p>
        <p>Below is an explanation of the improvements you can now enjoy.</p>
        <h2>Unified Search Experience</h2>
        <p>Upon visiting <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> technical documentation site, you'll encounter an upgraded search and filter functionality that intelligently scours through various document versions, presenting you with the most relevant information for all versions or a particular version.</p>
        <p>If you’re on the homepage of a different version for example, <a href="https://docs.gigaspaces.com/16.3/landing.html">version 16.3</a>, and perform a search on this page, the results will be pre-filtered to show relevant documentation only for the 16.3 version.</p>

        </p>
        <p>As you start typing your query, the search bar will offer the following helpful suggestions:</p>
        <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1.</span> This icon represents <b>previous searches</b> you have made, displaying the <b>most recent at the top</b>.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2.</span> This  icon represents queries which are the <b>closest match</b> to your question whilst also taking into account the top queries asked by other users.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3.</span> When you start typing a search query, the <b>Suggested Results</b> drop-down results section represents the top results related to your query. Click the page name to navigate directly to the page.</p>
        <p>If the result you are looking for is not included in the Suggest Results, complete typing your query and click Search on the search bar or Enter for a detailed view of the full search results page.</p>
        <h2>Full Search Page</h2>
        <p>Search algorithms work in the backend to extract the most useful documentation from our repository and rank the results based on their relevance. The search results page also allows you to achieve to the right results.</p>

                    <td>This is a core differentiator when it comes to the new search experience. You can narrow down the scope of your results by filtering them via product, versions, created date, and the type of documentation (for example, User Guide vs Installation Guide). Once you click a filter, you will notice that the results page is narrowed down to only include results based on your selection. If you want to clear the filters, you can simply deselect them from the left panel OR use the clear all filters option. </td>

 For more details, see <a href="https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/End-User-Personalization/Use-Advanced-Search.htm#AdvancedSearchForm">Advanced Search</a>.</p>
                        <p>
Four options are available:
</p>
                        <p>1) <b>With the exact phrase</b>. The query will be searched as it is. A search for "recognise" will not find the documents with the spelling "recognize". &#160;This search is also not case-sensitive.</p>
                        <p>2) <b>With One or more words</b>. All the documents containing even one word from the multiword query will be returned. For example, "fast food" will return documents containing the terms "fast", "food", and "fast food."</p>
                        <p>3) <b>Without the words</b>. The documents containing the query will be excluded. This is equivalent to adding a hyphen in front of a query in the search box. 
</p>
                        <p>4) <b>With the wildcard search</b>. Using <a href="https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/End-User-Personalization/Use-Advanced-Search.htm#AdvancedSearchForm">search operators</a> in the regular search box, advanced search queries start with an #. This field offers a way to run advanced searches without using #. Write your advanced search expression in this field to use it.
