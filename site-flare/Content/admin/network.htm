  <p>Some of the features described on this page are not part of the open-source edition, and are only available in the licensed editions (starting with XAP Premium).</p>
</div>

<p>This section explains how to configure the network to support your XAP implementation. XAP supports <a href="./network-unicast-discovery.htm/">unicast service discovery</a> and <a href="./network-multicast.htm/">multicast</a> where available (for both Linux and Microsoft Windows operating systems).</p>

<p>You can <a href="./network-lookup-service-configuration.htm/">configure the Lookup Service (LUS)</a> to work with both unicast and multicast. XAP is supported <a href="./network-over-nat.htm/">over NAT</a> and <a href="./network-over-firewall.htm/">over firewall</a>, and you can either <a href="./network-ports.htm/">use the default ports or specify custom ports</a> for the different XAP components and services. XAP can also be configured to work with a specific subset of network cards in environments with <a href="./network-multi-nic.htm/">multiple network cards</a>.</p>
