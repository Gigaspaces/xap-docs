        <h1>Smart Cache Overview</h1>
        <p>Smart Cache is <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> high-speed, distributed in-memory data storage and processing grid. The platform co-locates applications and data, offering ultra-low latency, high-throughput transaction and stream processing. Smart Cache offers unique capabilities that are not available in simple caching solutions, such as full SQL compatibility, mufti-criteria queries, dynamic server-side processing, full data integrity, policy-driven data tiering, seamless database integration, and cloud-native deployment.</p>
        <p>Smart Cache provides a highly-reliable, distributed, in-memory storage and processing engine. Essentially, it is an in-memory data grid designed to support  millisecond-level latency and millions of operations per second, providing for thousands of deployed services, and hundreds to thousands of concurrent users. This solution makes the implementation of distributed applications above the <a href="../dev-java/the-gigaspace-interface-overview.html">Space</a> simpler and less intrusive, enabling efficient building of highly scalable and highly performing applications.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;" MadCap:conditions="Version.16-0-died">&#160;</p>
        <p>Smart Cache offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>High availability, replication and persistence with optional data persistence and multi-datacenter replication</p>

            <li>
                <p>Full data life-cycle management on RAM,  SSD/Flash, disk and external data stores, also supporting multiple data tiers</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Supports a variety of data models, including <a href="../dev-java/pojo-overview.html">POJO</a>, Documents,  and Key/Value</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Seamlessly scales up and out with no downtime</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment, including <a href="../admin/kubernetes-s10-deploying-and-managing-gigaspaces.html">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="../solution-hub/ie-operator-openshift.html">OpenShift</a>, or use its own service grid orchestration mechanism</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Easily integrates with BI tools such as Tableau, Looker, and PowerBI</p>

            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Smart Cache runs server side processing, providing the high performance of advanced operations and avoiding data retrieval back to the client side. Aggregation is performed in-memory, on relevant data only, regardless of total data size. It uses <a href="../overview/space-based-architecture.html">Space-Based Architecture</a> (SBA) as a primary design pattern. With SBA, applications are built out of a set of self-sufficient units, known as <a href="../dev-java/the-processing-unit-overview.html">Processing Units</a> (PU). These units are completely independent of each other, so that an application can scale without increasing complexity, just by adding more units. SBA is based on the Tuple Space paradigm. SBA follows many of the principles of Service-Oriented Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture, as well as elements of grid computing.</p>

                <h3>Customized Routing</h3>
                <p>When the objects are written to the Data Grid, they are <a href="https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/dev-java/routing-in-partitioned-spaces.html?Highlight=routing">routed</a> to the proper partition, according to a predefined attribute in the object that acts as the routing index.
</p>

                <h2> Space-Based Architecture </h2>
                <p>The data grid also functions as an application server that enables applications running on the data grid to be scaled out linearly, using <a href="https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/overview/space-based-architecture.html">Space-Based Architecture</a> (SBA) as a primary design pattern. </p>
                <p>With SBA, applications are built out of a set of self-sufficient units, known as <a href="https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/dev-java/the-processing-unit-overview.html">Processing Units</a> (PU). These units are completely independent of each other, so that the application can scale indefinitely without increasing complexity, just by adding more units. SBA is based on the Tuple Space paradigm. SBA follows many of the principles of Service-Oriented Architecture and <a href="https://docs.gigaspaces.com/latest/dev-java/event-processing.html">Event-Driven Architecture</a>, as well as elements of grid computing.

                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> provides enterprise-grade high availability capabilities and 

can be scaled up and out on-line with no downtime.

<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> can be deployed on-prem, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment, including Kubernetes and OpenShift, or using its own orchestration mechanism.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Transaction Processing</h2>
            <p>Smart Cache provides a powerful solution for launching and running digital services. Its APIs support ultra-fast transaction processing and task execution that is event driven, offering high availability, reliability and scale. Smart Cache’s server side processing accelerates performance and reduces networking and serialization overhead, even during peaks with high numbers of concurrent users. The platform supports both Kubernetes and alternative elastic orchestration systems.</p>
            <p>Smart Cache offers efficient and cost-effective data replication across regions and clouds, and between cloud and on-premises deployments. It supports both polling and push notifications, including <a href="../dev-java/fifo-overview.html">FIFO</a> and <a href="../dev-java/fifo-grouping.html">FIFO grouping</a> ordering. Business rules can also be applied locally and remotely as they are embedded in each <a href="../admin/data-partitioning.html">partition</a> and on remote nodes.</p>
