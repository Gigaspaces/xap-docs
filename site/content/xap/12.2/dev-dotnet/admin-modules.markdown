The API provides information and the ability to operate on the currently running [GigaSpaces Agent](../overview/the-runtime-environment.html#gsa), [GigaSpaces Manager](../overview/the-runtime-environment.html#gsm), [GigaSpaces Container](../overview/the-runtime-environment.html#gsc), [Lookup Service](../overview/the-runtime-environment.html#lus), [Processing Unit](./the-processing-unit-overview.html) and Spaces.
