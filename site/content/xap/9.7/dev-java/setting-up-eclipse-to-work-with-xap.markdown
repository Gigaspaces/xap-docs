Follow these steps to prepare your development environment:


- **Ensure you have a JDK installed** - you will need version 1.6 or higher, latest Java 1.6 is recommended.

#### Checking your JDK version

To check your installed Java version:

1. Open a command line window.
1. Run `set JAVA_HOME`
1. A response similar to this suggests you have a JDK installed:


```java
JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.6
```

To check the JDK version, run `%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java \-version`. A response like this from `Java` indicates you have a valid JDK installed:


```java
java version "1.6.0_23"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_23-b05)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 11.0-b16, mixed mode, sharing)
```

If your installed JDK version is lower then 1.5 or none is installed, see below on how to install one.

#### Installing a proper JDK (Java Development Kit)

- To install JDK 1.6, download and install [**JDK 6 Update X**](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)

- **Install a Java IDE**: If you don't have an IDE installed, you can [download and unzip the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads), or the [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) IDE (we recommend the Ultimate Edition because of its excellent Spring framework support).
If you're using Eclipse, it is also recommended to install the [Spring Tool Suite plugin for Eclipse](http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts).
