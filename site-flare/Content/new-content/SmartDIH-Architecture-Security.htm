        <h2>IDP Integration</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> supports integration with identity providers (IDP) which support OpenId Connect protocol like Okta and Azure AD. Users or SpaceDeck (platform control and monitoring) are managed via the IDP and user groups in the IDP are mapped to roles.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>For IDP setup details refer to our <a href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-idp-details.html">SpaceDeck - SSO IDP Setup</a> page found in our User Guide</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Service Accounts</h2>
        <p>Service accounts represent components which integrate with the data-grid. An advanced user can write additional components and plug them into the system. These components must enroll in the Service Accounts section in SpaceDeck.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>For details about Service Accounts refer to our <a href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-idp-details.html" style="background-color: #ffff00;">SpaceDeck - Service Accounts</a> page found in our User Guide</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Roles &amp;&#160;Privileges</h2>
        <p>User and service accounts can be assigned to roles which limit their access to the data-grid and platform control. A role is a collection of privileges, each defines an allowed operation for a resource. Some privileges are system level and some are associated to specific resources which are either a data-grid level, a Space or a table.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>For details about Roles &amp;&#160;Privileges refer to the <a href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-admin.html#Roles-Mangement" style="background-color: #ffffff;">SpaceDeck - Role Management</a> information found in our User Guide</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Auditing</h2>
        <p>Each operation performed by SpaceDeck (pipelines, services, data-grid/Spaces) is audited and can be found in a log containing both the user ID and the operation performed. The IDP logs user logins and logouts.</p>
