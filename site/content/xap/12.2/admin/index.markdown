[Management Center](./gigaspaces-management-center.html){{<wbr>}}
GigaSpaces Management Center is a GUI that allows you to view spaces, containers, and clusters (and configure them), using the Space Browser tab. You can also deploy and manage services using the Deployments tab.

[Web Management Console](./web-management-console.html){{<wbr>}}
The web management console is a user interface where users can deploy, manage and monitor their Processing Units and Applications.

[REST Manager API](./xap-manager-rest.html)<br>
The XAP Manager provides a RESTful API for managing XAP environments.

[Data Grid clustering](./data-grid-clustering.html){{<wbr>}}
This section describes how the In-Memory-Data-Grid clustering works. It also provides details of the failover, load-balancing, and replication facilities used.

[Service Level Agreement](./the-sla-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
The XAP runtime environment (Service Grid) provides Service Level Agreement driven capabilities.

[Memory Management](./memory-management-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
This section explains the different Space cache policies, memory usage, and rules for exceeding physical memory capacity.

[MemoryXtend](./memoryxtend-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
This Storage interface allows Blob/Block/external type storage to act as a natural memory space for the IMDG.

[Logging](./logging-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
This section explains how to configure logging with XAP. It explains how to format the log output, and choose file names and rollover policies.

[Administration Tools](./administration-tools.html){{<wbr>}}
This section explains the command line interface that is used to deploy, manage and monitor Processing Units and Applications.

[The Service Grid](./runtime-configuration.html){{<wbr>}}
This section lists and explains the different runtime configuration parameters.

[Network Configuration](./network.html){{<wbr>}}
This section explains how to configure the network in order for XAP to work properly.

[Monitoring](./monitoring.html){{<wbr>}}
This section provides information on how to monitor XAP and your deployed application.

[Performance Tuning](./tuning.html) {{<wbr>}}
This section explains how to tune your XAP application. Amongst the topics covered are JVM tuning, thread usage and benchmarking.

[Benchmarking](./benchmarking.html){{<wbr>}}
Performance benchmarks with XAP's In-Memory Data Grid mainly involve testing latency and throughput.

[Quiesce Mode](./quiescemode.html){{<wbr>}}
Processing Units can be configured to be put into maintenance mode. When a processing unit is in maintenance mode, it rejects all data-related operations with an exception. This is useful when performing a safe shutdown or for a rolling system upgrade.

[Security](./security/index.html){{<wbr>}}
This section provides an understanding of GigaSpaces XAP Security, where it fits in the GigaSpaces architecture, which components can be secured, and how to configure and customize the security depending on your application security requirements.

[XAP as a Windows Service](./installation-windows-service.html){{<wbr>}}
When using a Windows-based operating system for running GigaSpaces infrastructure, users may want to convert the Grid Service Agent into a Windows service.

[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.html){{<wbr>}}
This section provides useful information on how to troubleshoot your XAP application.

[Moving into Production Checklist](./moving-into-production-checklist.html){{<wbr>}}
This list describes the main activities that should be performed prior moving your system into production.
