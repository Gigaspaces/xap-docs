        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The InsightEdge platform, a combination of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> in-memory data grid and an open-source analytics ecosystem, is an in-memory insight platform that supports fast-data analytics, artificial intelligence and real-time applications. Customers can use this platform to develop their own systems that provide instant data-driven insights with time-to-analytics at a sub-second scale, and the ability to hyperscale analytics from SQL, streaming to machine learning via Apache Spark.</p>
        <p>The InsightEdge platform provides extreme performance with ultra-low latency, high-throughput transactions and stream processing, due to the co-location of applications and analytics. All of this functionality is available in a cloud-native, infrastructure-agnostic deployment for hybrid cloud and on-premises environments.</p>
        <p>InsightEdge Enterprise offers the following additional benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Multi-tiered data storage across RAM, SSD, and Storage-Class Memory (3DXPoint)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
