The [Administration and Monitoring API]({{%currentjavaurl%}}/administration-and-monitoring-api.html) provides a way to administer and monitor all on XAP services and components using a simple API. The API, amongst others, provides the ability to operate on the currently running GigaSpaces Agents, XAP Managers, XAP Containers, Lookup Services, Processing Units and Spaces.



# Constructing the Admin instance

When using a secured Service Grid, the `Admin` instance needs to be constructed with a _principal_ which is granted sufficient privileges based on the operations being performed using the administration API. For example, grant `Manage Grid` to start a Grid Service Manager (GSM) and grant `Provision PU` to deploy a processing unit.

The following creates an `Admin` instance with the user "user/password".


```java
Admin admin = new AdminFactory().addGroup("gigaspaces").credentials("user", "password").createAdmin();
```

For security other than username/password see [Custom Authentication]

# Space Deployment

Deploying a secured Space:


```java
...
admin.getGridServiceManagers().deploy(new SpaceDeployment("mySpace").secured(true));
```

Deploying a secured Space with credentials supplied. These credentials propagate to internal services, such as Space Filters.


```java
...
admin.getGridServiceManagers().deploy(new SpaceDeployment("mySpace").userDetails("myUser", "myPassword"));
```

# Processing Unit Deployment

Deploying a secured Processing Unit. This will deploy a Processing Unit with a secured embedded Space.


```java
...
admin.getGridServiceManagers().deploy(new ProcessingUnitDeployment("myPu").secured(true));
```

Deploying a secured Processing Unit with credentials supplied. With this approach, credentials do not need to be hardcoded in the `pu.xml` declaration. These credential propagate to all the beans which require a proxy to the space.


```java
...
admin.getGridServiceManagers().deploy(new ProcessingUnitDeployment("myPu").userDetails("myUser", "myPassword"));
```
