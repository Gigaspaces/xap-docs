The XAP Unified Grid Manager (UGM) is a component which stacks together the [LUS](/product_overview/service-grid.html#the-lookup-service-lus) and [GSM](/product_overview/service-grid.html#grid-service-manager-gsm) 
along with [Zookeeper]({{%currentadmurl%}}/zookeeper.html) and an embedded web application which hosts an admin instance with a REST API on top of it. 
It simplifies setup and management of the XAP environment.
