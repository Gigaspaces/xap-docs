        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Deploying Services</h1>
        <p>There are several types of Services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Stateful PU/Service - This is space containing data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stateless PU/Service - These are built-in services such as mirror wan-GW, data-GW and custom services</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Client Services - These are applications which interact with spaces</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is also possible to develop new services based on <a href="../started/first-data-grid.html">Blueprints</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Low-Code  Micro-Services </h3>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>The creation of low-code micro-services is relevant for Smart DIH only. &#160;It is recommended to use this method to start stateless services.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Through our <a href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-services.html">SpaceDeck</a>, easy low-code data access micro-services can be created.</p>

                        <p><b>Service:</b> Exposes a single outward-facing endpoint to this application on the cluster (internal network)</p>
                        <p><b>Ingress:</b> Makes the HTTP (or HTTPS) network service available using protocol aware URIs, for example and external network</p>

        <h2>Service Creator </h2>
        <p>Services creation is managed by a Service&#160;Creator operator which uses a service which exposes REST&#160;endpoints.</p>
