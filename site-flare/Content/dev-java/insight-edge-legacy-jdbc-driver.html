            <p>Traditionally, customers adopting our platform come from a database (SQL) background.
In order to give them a familiar interface for looking into what data exists in the grid, we created a SQL adapter that lets them query the grid as if it's a traditional database.</p>
            <p>This gives the opportunity to plug in existing visualization tools like:<br />* <a href="tableau-integration.html">Tableau</a> <br />* <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/us" target="_blank">MicroStrategy</a><br />* <a href="https://www.visualintelligence.co.nz/qlikview/" target="_blank">QlikView</a><br />directly into the grid and use a drag and drop interface to look into grid data.</p>
            <p>The JDBC driver is <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">based on <a href="https://calcite.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Calcite</a> and was </MadCap:conditionalText>designed to allow only SQL-compatible read operations against data stored in the grid.
It does not support create/update/delete operations. Furthermore, the driver was not designed for low latency requirements, although it was developed for integration with applications such as visualization tools, which support JDBC-compliant data sources.</p>

                <p>If you are looking for a low-latency JDBC driver with CRUD capability, refer to the <a href="jdbc-driver.html">JDBC Driver</a> topic in the Developer guide.</p>
