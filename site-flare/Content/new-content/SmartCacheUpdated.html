        <h1>Smart Cache Overview</h1>
        <p>Smart Cache is a high-speed, distributed in-memory data storage and processing grid. The platform co-locates applications and data, offering ultra-low latency, high-throughput transaction and stream processing. Smart Cache offers unique capabilities that are not available in simple caching solutions, such as full SQL compatibility, mufti-criteria queries, dynamic server-side processing, full data integrity, policy-driven data tiering, seamless database integration, and cloud-native deployment.</p>
        <p>Smart Cache provides a highly-reliable, distributed, in-memory storage and processing engine. Essentially, it is an in-memory data grid designed to support  millisecond-level latency and millions of operations per second, providing for thousands of deployed services, and hundreds to thousands of concurrent users. This solution makes the implementation of distributed applications above the <a href="../dev-java/the-gigaspace-interface-overview.html">Space</a> simpler and less intrusive, enabling efficient building of highly scalable and highly performing applications.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Architecture of Smart Cache</i>
            </p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Smart Cache runs server side processing, providing the high performance of advanced operations and avoiding data retrieval back to the client side. Aggregation is performed in-memory, on relevant data only, regardless of total data size. It uses Space-Based Architecture (SBA) as a primary design pattern. With SBA, applications are built out of a set of self-sufficient units, known as Processing Units (PU). These units are completely independent of each other, so that an application can scale without increasing complexity, just by adding more units. SBA is based on the Tuple Space paradigm. SBA follows many of the principles of Service-Oriented Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture, as well as elements of grid computing.</p>
            <h2>Transaction Processing</h2>
            <p>Smart Cache provides a powerful solution for launching and running digital services. Its APIs support ultra-fast transaction processing and task execution that is event driven, offering high availability, reliability and scale. Smart Cache’s server side processing accelerates performance and reduces networking and serialization overhead, even during peaks with high numbers of concurrent users. The platform supports both Kubernetes and alternative elastic orchestration systems.</p>
            <p>Smart Cache offers efficient and cost-effective data replication across regions and clouds, and between cloud and on-premises deployments. It supports both polling and push notifications, including FIFO and FIFO grouping ordering. Business rules can also be applied locally and remotely as they are embedded in each partition and on remote nodes.</p>
            <h2>High Availability</h2>
            <p>Smart Cache is an always-on, ACID-compliant and secured system, with disaster recovery ensured  through efficient data replication (Active-Passive) between sites, including hybrid environments.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="../Resources/Images/SmartCacheHA.png" />
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">Highly Available partitions with primary backup instances</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>High availability is achieved through the following levels with primary and backup instances:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Partition Level:</b> Highly-available partitions with synchronic data replication between primary  and backup instances for in-memory high availability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Cluster Level</b>: Tier storage and disk persistence, together with built-in mirroring service to an  external database or disk, including initial load and store to database, delivering disk persistence to any storage class or database.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Site Level</b>: Efficient asynchronous data replication (active-passive or active-active) between  sites or regions, including hybrid environment for conflict resolution and disaster recovery.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Multi-Region Replication</h2>
            <p>Multi-Region Replication is implemented for disaster recovery planning, where each site is distant from the other sites, even on a different continent; for failover scenarios when one site acts as a failover target for another, or to maintain data locality for performance or regulations. For more information, see Multi-Region Replication.</p>
            <h2>Distributed WAN Gateway</h2>
            <p>The WAN Gateway enables bidirectional replication of data between cloud repositories or to and from cloud storage. This distributed WAN Gateway is totally stateless, ensuring no loss of data. Transactions at the local site are replicated in atomic manner in the correct order to the remote sites. Site bootstrapping ensures that once a site starts, it can reload its entire data or specific data from a remote site without introducing data consistency problems.</p>
            <p>The WAN Gateway replication utilizes a custom plugin that allows users to filter or modify data before it is replicated, and also after it has been replicated at each source or target node. In addition, the WAN replication topology can be updated in runtime - adding or removing remote sites does not result in system shutdown.</p>
            <h2>Persistence</h2>
            <p>Smart Cache data persistence consists of two components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Space Data Source</b>: Handles the pre-loading of data and the lazy load of data from from the persistence layer</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Space Synchronization Endpoint</b>: Handles changes made within the space delegation to the  persistence layer</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This Space persistence provides classes which can be extended and then used to load and store data  in an existing data source. Data is loaded from the data source during space initialization, after which the application works with the space directly.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">Smart Cache Persistency Components</p>
            <h2>Mirror Service</h2>
            <p>The GigaSpaces mirror service (write behind) provides reliable asynchronous persistence. This allows for the asynchronous delegation of the operations conducted with the In-Memory-Data-Grid (IMDG) into a backend database, significantly reducing the performance overhead. This service ensures that data will not be lost in the event of a failure.</p>
            <p>A mirror service can be attached to an application, providing fine-grained control of the objects that need to be persisted, without affecting the real-time portion of the app in either configuration or code. The mirror does not require a backup instance since it does not maintain any state. The actual state of the latest committed database transaction is stored within the primary and the backup space instances, not in the mirror.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="../Resources/Images/SmartCacheMirror.png" />
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">Mirror Service (Write Behind)</p>
            <h2>Scaling</h2>
            <p>Smart Cache delivers a scaling process that offers almost no downtime while the system scales. This scaling can be performed both horizontally and vertically, enabling the increase or reduction of the number of partitions allocated to a service.</p>
            <p>Vertical scaling allows the increase or decrease of the amount of RAM and CPU for an active GigaSpaces cluster – such as the addition of memory or CPUs to an existing physical node - without downtime. Vertical scaling offers many advantages:</p>
            <p>Resources are located in close physical proximity, enabling faster access to related data such as credit/debit tables that are updated in a closed (atomic) unit of work</p>
            <p>A performance gain, because more RAM and CPUs are available for each update</p>
            <p>Horizontal scaling allows adding and reducing the number of partitions used for an application, such as the creation of additional partitions in the same server, or the addition/removal of servers. Horizontal scaling supports linear increases in capacity on-the-fly; RAM or CPU capacity can be increased or decreased while maintaining a constant RAM/CPU ratio.</p>
            <p>Smart Cache supports the full SQL-99 standard, allowing complex queries to be performed with optimal speed and minimal memory footprint. Standard SQL requests used for relational data manipulation can be used without requiring source code changes. Using Java and .NET APIs, advanced capabilities are available — such as object store, and various data modeling options.</p>
            <h2>Management of Smart Cache</h2>
            <p>The REST Manager API and UI tools enable management of the Smart Cache cluster in Kubernetes deployments, providing typical information (such as parameters and responses) for each operation. This API  enables administration of local, remote, and cloud-based application environments.</p>
            <h3>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>
            <p>The GigaSpaces CLI enables users to administer local, remote, and cloud-based application environments, and for maintenance tasks. The CLI is based on the REST Manager API.</p>
            <h2>Supported APIs</h2>
            <h3>Java Integration</h3>
            <p>The Java SDK offers the best expected performance, with full coverage of Space interfaces and functions.</p>
            <h3>.NET Integration</h3>
            <p>Smart Cache supports C# on .NET Framework and .NETCore so that developers can perform all required operations within the Space in .NET.</p>
            <p>Server-side Java and client-side .Net operations available in Java can be performed in .NET.</p>
            <p>The data is saved in Java within the Space. The .NET Integration supports C# on both .NET Framework and .NETCore.</p>
            <h3>JDBC / ODBC</h3>
            <p>To connect with the Space, the GigaSpaces JDBC API  allows applications to interact with the Space, using JDBC or ODBC drivers. A query processor transparently translates SQL queries into legal Space operations. No integration is required, the application can just point to the GigaSpaces JDBC driver like any other JDBC driver.</p>

            </p>
            <h2>Deployment</h2>
            <p>Smart Cache is cloud native and can be deployed on any public, private cloud or hybrid environment. Key features of this deployable anywhere approach to out-of-the-box, fully agnostic cloud  management functionality include:</p>
            <p>Easy deployment and provisioning across any scale, on cloud, on-premises and hybrid environments</p>
            <p>Hot rolling and automated deployment, upgrading, monitoring, scaling and recovery</p>
            <p>Support of Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift and alternative elastic orchestration systems, with no need for  third-party components, reducing TCO and enabling the handling of unexpected peaks.</p>
            <p>Efficient and cost-effective data replication across regions/clouds or between on-premises and cloud deployments.</p>
