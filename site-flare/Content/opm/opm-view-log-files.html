        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Viewing Partition Log Files with Ops Manager</h1>
        <p>A log file is available with detailed information about each partition.</p>
        <p>To view the log file for a partition, click on <b>View Log</b> on the menu that appears when hovering over the three dots on one of the partition instances:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-viewing-scaling-log.jpg" class="tc-picture80" />
        </p>
        <p>This displays the log for the partition:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../Resources/Static/images/SUSD-view-log.jpg" class="tc-picture80" />
        </p>
        <p>The log entries are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent entries at the top of the listing.</p>
        <p>Note the numbered items indicated in the example above:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If Auto-Refresh is off (default), the log is not refreshed. Auto-Refresh on causes the log to be dynamically refreshed as new entries are generated. </li>
            <li>When Auto-Refresh is off, click here to refresh the log.</li>
            <li>Click here to download the log file manually.</li>
            <li>Using the browser's built-in Find capability, you can search for text in the log.</li>
