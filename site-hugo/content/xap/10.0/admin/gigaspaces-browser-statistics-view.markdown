# Operations Statistics Status

The **Operations Statistics Status** area displays the total number of operations performed in the space. The **Legend** on the right side, apart from color indication, provides a check box for every operation, allowing you to remove it from the graph.

# TP Statistics History

The bottom left side graph is displayed depending on the selected option:

- **TP \[Operations/Sec\] History** -- displays throughput performance (operations per second).
- **Total Operations Count History** -- displays the space operations' history. The graph represents the number of operations performed since you began working with the space.

Additional options:

- **Clear** button -- clears the graph.
- The **Graph Scaling** area in the bottom right provides a check box for every operation, allowing you to remove it from the graph.

# Refresh Options

You can choose to refresh the statistics display periodically. When auto refresh is running, a green blinking dot is displayed on the right side of the screen. Select the desired refresh rate from the drop-down menu. To stop the statistics automatic refresh, click the **Stop** button.

Auto-refresh activity impacts server performance, so you might want to stop it when running benchmarks.
