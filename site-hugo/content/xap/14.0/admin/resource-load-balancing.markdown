Our new demote capability in the REST Manager API, which supports both InsightEdge and XAP, makes it easier, faster, and simpler to rebalance a system after significant environment change scenarios, such as  failover or scaling.  In the past, the only way to demote a primary instance in order to rebalance a system was to force a restart, which required downtime until the new primary was up and running, and until the backup fully recovered. Now customers can write their own rebalancing policies  that take advantage of the ability to perform a hot swap during runtime.
