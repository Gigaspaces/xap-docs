<h1>Querying the Space</h1>
  

<p>This section explains the various mechanisms offered by GigaSpaces XAP to query the space for data:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="query-by-id.htm">ID query</a> - Retrieve objects from the Space based on the Primary Key.</li>
<li><a href="query-template-matching.htm">Query by template</a> - Find data based on template matching (a.k.a. Match by example).</li>
<li><a href="query-sql.htm">SQL query</a> - The SQLQuery class is used to query the space using SQL-like syntax.</li>
<li><a href="query-sql-function.htm">SQL Function</a> - You can query the Space using built-in and user-defined functions.</li>
<li><a href="query-geospatial.htm">Geospatial query</a> - Use geometry data types such as points, circles and polygons (these queries consider the spatial relationship between the geometries).</li>
<li><a href="query-nested-properties.htm">Nested property query</a> - Use SQL queries on nested properties, maps and collections.</li>
<li><a href="query-user-defined-classes.htm">Query with user-defined classes</a> - Query by matching a user-defined class.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also perform a <a href="query-free-text-search.htm">free text search</a> for records that include one or more words within a free text field, and a <a href="query-full-text-search.htm">full text search</a> that leverages the Lucene search engine library.</p>

<p>The following related topics describe how to use indexing to boost query performance, and how the Space can be iterated to fetch entries more efficiently:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="query-paging-support-old.htm">Paging support</a> - Reading a large number of objects using multiple queries in one call, in a continuous manner.</li>
<li><a href="query-partial-results.htm">Partial results - Projection</a> - You can obtain partial results when querying the Space, to improve application performance and reduce the memory footprint.</li>
<li><a href="query-explainplan.htm">Explain Plan</a> - This can be used to obtain a description of the strategy or plan that XAP uses to implement a specific SQLQuery.</li>
</ul>
