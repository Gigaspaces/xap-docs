        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">ElastiGrid</h1>
        <p>This section describes how to deploy  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> in cloud-native environments using the GigaOps stack, which is comprised of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">ElastiGrid</span> - orchestration option for cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environments that provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of virtualized and containerized applications.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">gsctl</span> - a standalone CLI tool that you can use to create, provision, and install <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> clusters in the cloud or on premise.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">Ops Manager</span> - the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> native administration and monitoring tool, which is web based and runs automatically when <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> services are deployed.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">Monitoring stack</span> - based on InfluxDB, Grafana, and Telegraf for monitoring <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> cluster activity and metrics using dashboards</li>
        </ul>
        <p>how users use GigaSpaces?</p>
        <p>Using our product is consisted of few steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating and maintaining the infrastructure (servers - on-premise/cloud)</li>
            <li>Developing applications</li>
            <li>Periodical upgrade of the product and/or the user’s applications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>to install the product:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Users need to download and install the product in every server they have</li>
            <li>Do some configurations by editing few files (e.g. license, lookups)</li>
            <li>Run our main component and monitor it in case it fails</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Most likely the customer develops a script or a tool that does all of the above. This is the Ops part.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Two years ago, we added a support for Kubernetes which is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.</p>
        <p>Given you have a Kubernetes cluster running, deploying our product and the user’s applications is relatively easy.</p>
        <p>While the cloud providers allows running a Kubernetes cluster, having an on premise cluster can be hard and complex especially the configuration part.</p>
        <p>Developing on Kubernetes can be complex when you need to expose your application to the outside world</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>What is DevOps stack?</p>
        <p>Machines provision *</p>
        <p>Declarative software installation and orchestration *</p>
        <p>Monitoring *</p>
        <p>Controlled upgrades</p>
        <p>Auto Scaling</p>
        <p>Tooling for developing and troubleshooting</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>With DSO, we eliminate this complexity by giving our customers a "1-click" Provisioning and installation, on-premise and in cloud with a built in monitoring.From zero to wow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provisioning machines on the cloud or on premise, minimal configuration  (at this stage run the provisioning command for the demo, you can open aws web to see the machines as they created to enhance the dramatic effect)</li>
            <li>Declarative software installation and orchestration - very similar to what kubernetes does, (Now run the second stage of building the cluster explain what it does), it means that we can write the type of software that we wish to install and the requirements of each of them in terms of memory and CPU and the devops stack will install and manage those software on the nodes according to the constraint we defined, in case of cluster changes the devops stack will make adjustments.</li>
            <li>Collecting and displaying metrics on all the hardware as well as all the software defined on the nodes.</li>
            <li>By using standard metrics tools we make it very easy for customer to design his own view. (The grafana should be ready by now so you can show it on the real cluster, mention that you just got a cluster on the cloud with zero configuration, show how to deploy manager, stateless (you can call it space, and feeder, show the UI as they are starting, after they start show metrics from grafana and shut down the demo)</li>
            <li>No more 1 or 0 upgrade, user have tools to upgrade parts of the system while the system is running and monitor the results.</li>
            <li>Not only the software can scale but the cluster can change it size as well.</li>
            <li>Docker is not mandatory, development is much easier, aggregate and filter logs, log MDC search for workflow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>What’s in it for you</p>
        <p>Zero configuration provisioning, monitoring and cloud native are already working</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

## Using Apache Zeppelin with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />

Apache Zeppelin is a multi-purpose web notebook that supports data ingestion and discovery, as well as data analytics, visualization, and collaboration.

Apache Zeppelin contains a built-in Apache Spark integration. This provides the following:

- Automatic SparkContext and SQLContext injection
- Runtime JAR dependency loading from the local file system or Maven repository
- Ability to view job progress and cancel jobs 

The Zeppelin notebook packaged with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> includes several <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> demo applications, along with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />-specific settings that can be configured in the Spark interpreter in order to establish the connection between Spark and the data grid. 

KubeGrid runs Apache Zeppelin in a dedicated Pod, to enable ???
