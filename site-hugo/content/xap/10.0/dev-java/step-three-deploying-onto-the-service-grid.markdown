#### Application Components

{{% section %}}
{{% column width="70%" %}}

The Processing Unit that we deploy onto the Service Grid is our Hello World Processor from the [previous step](./step-two-creating-the-hello-world-application.html).
Reminder - the Feeder application writes each Message object to the processor Processing Unit, which in turn processes them.

#### Infrastructure (Service Grid) Components

The _Service Grid_ is a set of containers (_Grid Service Containers_ - GSCs) managed by one or more managers (_Grid Service Managers_ - GSMs).
Each Grid Service Container runs inside its own JVM. The containers themselves host _Processing Units_.
The Grid Service Manager manages the deployment of processing units and their provisioning to the the Grid Service Containers. In production scenarios you may want to have more than one manager, so it does not become a single point of failure.
The _GigaSpaces Management Center_ is the graphical user interface for administrating and monitoring the _Service Grid_ and the deployed applications.

#### Deployment Overview

In this tutorial we deploy the Hello World Processor onto the service Grid, first as a single instance (Figure 3), then with an additional backup instance to support failover (Figure 4).

{{% anchor Deployment Process %}}

## Deployment Process

After the Hello World Processor application is [built and put into a JAR file](#Deploy and Run), we [start the Service Grid Components](#Start Service Grid). We use the _Management Center GUI_ to deploy the Hello World Processor to the Service Grid, first as a [single instance](#Deploy As Single Instance), and then [with a backup instance as well](#deploy with backup), to demonstrate failover.

**What happens during the deployment process**
Deploying a Processing Unit is done by selecting its JAR file for deployment from the _Management Center_ user interface. The JAR is then passed to the _Grid Service Manager_, which analyzes its deployment requirements (These requirements are expressed in a file called the _Deployment Descriptor_) The Grid Manager then provisions the Processing Unit instances into the _Grid Service Containers_, which in turn load the processing unit binaries from the _Grid Service Manager_ and start the Processing Unit instance - see Figure 5 below.

{{% anchor Failover %}}

## Failover to a Backup Instance

To achieve failover capabilities and avoid a single point of failure, the Processing Unit is deployed with two instances - a primary and a backup. All objects written to the space of the primary instance are synchronously replicated to the backup instance, thus enabling quick failover to the backup instance in case the primary instance fails.
In addition, after the failover, the _Grid Service Manager_ provisions a new backup to another Grid Service Container (if it exists), to maintain high availability for the Processing Unit. This is the self-healing part of the GigaSpaces deployment mechanism.

{{% /align %}}

#### Feeder View of the Failover Process

Since the feeder interacts with (writes objects to) the space, using a space proxy, which hides the actual deployment topology and runtime status from it, the whole failover process is completely transparent to it.
The only noticeable effect may be a slight delay in the space response time to the feeder calls.

## Starting the Service Grid Components and Deploying the Application

**Steps to deploy the application:**

**Install GigaSpaces**

{{% exclamation %}} After going through the previous tutorial [Step Two - Creating the Hello World Application](./step-two-creating-the-hello-world-application.html), you should have GigaSpaces installed and the Hello World sample application environment set. If not, please [download GigaSpaces and set up your development environment](./installation-guide.html) to work with GigaSpaces - this is needed to run the tutorial sample application.

{{% anchor Start Service Grid %}}

#### Starting the Service Grid Components

1. Start **GigaSpaces Management Center (GS-UI)** by running `<XAP Root>/bin/gs-ui.bat(.sh)`.
1. Start a **GigaSpaces Agent (GSA)** by running `<XAP Root>/bin/gs-agent.(sh/bat)`.
The GSA, by default, will start 2 local Grid Service Containers, and manage a global Grid Service Manager and a global Lookup Service.

{{%accordion%}}
{{%accord title=" What is a GigaSpaces Agent..."%}}
{{% panel   %}}

**The GigaSpaces Agent**

[The GigaSpaces Agent (GSA)](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsa) acts as a process manager that can spawn and manage Service Grid processes (Operating System level processes) such as the Grid Service Manager (aka [The GigaSpaces Manager](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsm)), the Grid Service Container (aka [The GigaSpaces Container](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsc)), and Lookup Service.

{{% /panel %}}
{{%/accord%}}
{{%/accordion%}}


A new Grid Service Manager starts on your local machine, and its output can be viewed by clicking its name **gsm-1** inside the **Hosts** tab.
A new Grid Service Containers start on your local machine, and its output can be viewed by clicking their names **gsc-1**/**gsc-2** inside the **Hosts** tab.
The Grid Service Manger automatically detects the Grid Service Containers. Now we have a Service Grid with one manager and two containers up and running!

{{% sub %}}(The Service Grid Components started here are _local_ services, all running on your own machine. Naturally, in a production environment, they are started on separate machines, using the startup scripts that the product provides.){{% /sub %}}

{{% anchor Prepare Single Instance %}}

#### Deploying the Application with No Backup Instances

**Prepare the Processor Processing Unit for deployment with No Backups**

1. Build the processor Processing Unit by running `<Hello World Example Root>/build.bat(.sh) dist`.
 This compiles the Processor source files and creates the processing unit JAR file, ready for deployment under `<Hello World Example Root>/processor/pu/hello-processor.jar`.

{{% anchor Deploy As Single Instance %}}
**Deploying the Hello World Processor with No Backup**

1. Click the **Deploy Processing Unit Button** ![deploy_processing_unit_button.jpg](/attachment_files/deploy_processing_unit_button.jpg) to open the **Deployment Wizard** dialog.
1. Click the **Processing Unit** field **...** button, to browse for the processing unit JAR file.
1. Browse to the **hello-processor.jar** JAR file, located at `<Hello World Example Root>/processor/pu` folder, and select it.
1. Click the **Deploy** button, to deploy and wait for the processing unit to be provisioned to the running Grid Service Container.

{{% anchor Run Feeder %}}

#### Running the Feeder

1. Start the feeder by running `<Hello World Example root>/build.bat(.sh) run-feeder`.

Before deploying the application with a backup, we first undeploy the current single instance deployment:

{{% anchor undeploy %}}

#### Undeploying the Single Instance Deployment

1. In the **Deployed Processing Units tab**, under the **Processing Units** tree, right click the **hello-processor* deployment and click *Undeploy**.
1. Click **Yes** to approve.

{{% anchor deploy with backup %}}

#### Deploying as a Single Instance with Backup

{{% note "For Community Edition Users "%}}
If you are a community edition user, please note that you will not be able to perform this step since the community edition limits the number of space instances to one
{{% /note %}}

{{% anchor Prepare Single With Backup %}}
**Prepare the Processor Processing Unit for deployment as a single instance with backup**

1. Edit the processor's  **pu.xml** configuration file located under `<XAP root>/examples/helloworld/processor/src/META-INF/spring` folder.
1. Uncomment (Remove the surrounding <!-- -->), or add the following SLA bean definition, which contains the deployment configuration, to the **pu.xml** file:


```xml
<os-sla:sla
	cluster-schema="partitioned-sync2backup"
	number-of-instances="1"
	number-of-backups="1"
	max-instances-per-vm="1">
</os-sla:sla>
```

1. Build the processor Processing Unit by running `<Hello World Example Root>/build.bat(.sh) dist`.
This compiles the processor into a JAR file, ready for deployment, located under `<Hello World Example Root>/processor/pu/hello-processor.jar`.

{{% anchor Deploy as a Single Instance with Backup %}}
**Deploying the Hello World Processor as a Single Instance with Backup**


1. Click the **Deploy Processing Unit Button* ![deploy_processing_unit_button.jpg](/attachment_files/deploy_processing_unit_button.jpg) to open the *Deployment Wizard** dialog.
1. Click the **Processing Unit** field **...** button, to browse for the processing unit JAR file.
1. Browse to the **hello-processor.jar** JAR file, located at `<Hello World Example Root>/processor/pu` folder, and select it.
1. Click the **Deploy** button, to deploy and wait for the processing unit instances to be provisioned to the running Grid Service Containers.

{{% anchor Run Feeder2 %}}

#### Running the Feeder

1. Start the feeder by running `<Hello World Example root>/build.bat(.sh) run-feeder`
