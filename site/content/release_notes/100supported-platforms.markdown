# Overview

GigaSpaces XAP Data-Grid , Messaging-Grid , Compute-Grid , local cache , remoting , Persistency, Service Grid and OpenSpaces API are 100% Java technology based.

GigaSpaces XAP is supported on every operating system that supports the Java Platform Standard Edition technology - i.e., Windows , Linux x86, Linux AMD64 (Opteron), Oracle Solaris, Hewlett Packard HP-UX, IBM P-Series PowerPC AIX, Apple Mac OS/X, etc.

The list below represents the platforms that are regularly tested by GigaSpaces.

{{%info%}}GigaSpaces components (space, cluster of spaces, Processing Unit, GSM, GSC, LUS, Mahalo, GUI, CLI) can run only with the same GigaSpaces JARs (i.e., the same version and build number).{{%/info%}}

# Mixing XAP Versions
The following is supported:

- Runtime backward compatibility: Starting from GigaSpaces 8.0, GigaSpaces Space instances are backward compatible with Space clients across major versions. That means that clients running on version 9.0, 9.0 or 9.1 are compatible with Space instances running on version 10.0.
- Binary compatibility: applications built using 9.0.x or higher run without any code changes on a clean 10.0.x installation.
- Servers (GSMs, GSCs and Space instances) running on any future service pack of version 10.0 (e.g. 10.0.1) are guaranteed to work with older service packs of that version (e.g. 10.0).


# Tested & Certified Platforms

Recommended and Certified Environment

GigaSpaces is being tested with (32bit and 64bit JVMs):

- Windows 2008 Server SP2
- Linux RHEL 5.x/6.x
- Solaris 10
- [VMWare guidelines](/release_notes/97vmware-guidelines.html)

{{%warning%}}
SUSE-10 sp3 has bugs which make the OS network layer unreliable. This OS should be avoided with GigaSpaces.
{{%/warning%}}

Tested JVMs:

- Oracle 6 - XAP was tested using Sun JVM version 6u43 and above.
- Oracle 7 - XAP was tested using Sun JVM version 7u45 and above.
- IBM 1.6.0 - XAP was tested using IBM JVM version 1.6.0 SR15. 
- IBM 1.7.0 - XAP was tested using IBM JVM version 1.7.0 SR6.

{{%note%}}
Using IBM jdk there might be a problem in xml parsing package bundled with jdk,in previous GS version the xml parsing package was bundled with the product. Starting with 10.1 this is no longer the case. In case of a problem 'working' xml parsing package should be added to GS boot class path.
{{%/note%}}

GigaSpaces recommends that customers upgrade to a fully-supported environment, such as the latest GigaSpaces XAP 10.0.x and the latest *Java 1.7/1.8 SDK.

# End-of-Life Java Versions

- Java SE 1.5 EOL - based on information made publicly available by The Oracle Corporation (formerly Sun Microsystems), as of October 30th 2009, Java SE 1.5 SDK has reached its End of Service Life (EOSL).
- Oracle has already ceased to support the 1.5 JVM. In addition, the other major JVM vendor, namely IBM, announced its limited ability to support these JVMs in light of Oracle's announcement. This in turn will limit GigaSpaces' ability to provide support for applications running on this JVM.
- From version 8.0 onwards, GigaSpaces XAP no longer supports the Java 1.5 SDK, and will require the use of Java 1.6 SDK or higher.

{{%note%}}Please refer to the public website page for the latest updates about the [JVM & Third-Party End-Of-Life Policy](http://www.gigaspaces.com/EOL).{{%/note%}}
