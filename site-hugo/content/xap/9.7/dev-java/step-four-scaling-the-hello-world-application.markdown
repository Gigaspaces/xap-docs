#### Application Components

The Processing Unit we deploy onto the Service Grid is our Hello World Processor application from the [previous steps](./your-first-xtp-application.html). Reminder - a feeder application writes each Message object to the processor Processing Unit, which is in turn processed by the Processor class.

#### Infrastructure (Service Grid) Components

The _Service Grid_ is a set of containers (_Grid Service Containers_ - GSCs) managed by one or more a managers (_Grid Service Managers_ - GSMs).
Each Grid Service Container runs inside its own JVM. The containers themselves host _Processing Units_.
The Grid Service Manager manages the deployment of processing units and their provisioning to the the Grid Service Containers. In production scenarios you may want to have more than one manager, so it does not become a single point of failure.
The _GigaSpaces Management Center_ is the graphical user interface for administrating and monitoring the _Service Grid_ and the deployed applications.

#### Scaled-Out Deployment Layout

In this tutorial we scale the Hello World Processor we created in the the [previous steps](./your-first-xtp-application.html).
First we scale it to 3 instances (Figure 3), and then into 4 instances, divided into two primary instances and two backup instances (Figure 4).

## Understanding the Concept of Scaling, using Routing and Partitions

#### Scalability

**Scalability** is the ability to grow your application - i.e. increase its throughput, without changing code, and without sacrificing service levels (latency).

**Linear scalability** is the ability to grow as much as needed at fixed hardware/software unit per capacity unit: Adding X hardware unit = getting additional X throughput (again, without sacrificing service levels)- see Figure 5.

{{% align center %}}![Linear Scalibility.jpg](/attachment_files/Linear Scalibility.jpg)
{{% sub %}}**Figure 5. Linear vs. Non-linear Scalability**{{% /sub %}}{{% /align %}}

#### Scaling Using Processing Units

When your application is modeled as a Processing Unit, scaling it is as simple as adding more Processing Unit instances. Since processing units are self sufficient in the sense that they do not depend on any external component, this means that by increasing the number of Processing Unit instances that are used to by your application, you linearly (and of course predictably) increase its throughput. For example, if 2 Processing Unit instances can process 10K operations per second, 3 instances will process 15K, 4 instances 20K, and so on - see Figure 6.

{{% align center %}}![Partition on machines.jpg](/attachment_files/Partition on machines.jpg)
{{% sub %}}**Figure 6. N machines hosting N Grid Service Containers: each Container runs a Processing Unit.**{{% /sub %}}{{% /align %}}

#### Partitioning and Routing

As mentioned earlier, scaling is done by making sure each Processing Unit instance runs independently of the other instances (you may recall the car wash analogy from [step one of this tutorial](./step-one-using-processing-units-for-scaling.html). This is done by making sure that the data that is needed to perform a certain business operation, resides in the same Processing Unit instance that does the actual processing (this is called data affinity). This in turn guarantees two things - latency is kept at a fixed minimum, and is not related to the number of processing unit instances that are used by the application.
This is achieved by dividing the application data into partitions (each partition resides on a separate Processing Unit instance, in the form of a space), and intelligently distributing the data to these partitions. The business logic services deployed on each instance, operate only on the partition local to them, i.e. the one collocated in the same Processing Unit instance. This ensures extremely low latency, because data is kept in memory. It also ensures linear scalability when increasing the number of Processing Unit instances - see Figure 7 below.

{{% align center %}}![Partition.jpg](/attachment_files/Partition.jpg)
{{% sub %}}**Figure 7. 3 Processing Unit instances: each holds a different subset of the data, marked with different colors.**{{% /sub %}}
{{% sub %}}**A client connecting to this system, views the space partitions in all of these instances, as a single virtual resource.**{{% /sub %}}{{% /align %}}

**Routing** - Partitioning is implemented using a hash-based data routing mechanism. Each Processing Unit is running a separate partition. When a client interacts with the space cluster (reads or writes data), it is routed transparently to the correct partition. The routing mechanism is applied transparently on the client side by the space proxy.

{{% sub %}}**Figure 8. Partitioning is implemented using a hash-based routing mechanism. Each object is transparently routed to the correct partition by the client side proxy**.{{% /sub %}}
{{% /align %}}

**Routing Index** - When writing an object to a cluster of Processing Units which contains multiple partitions, the routing of that object to a specific partition, is calculated based on the value of one of the object's properties. This property is designated using the `@SpaceRouting` annotation, and is referred to as the **Routing Index**.

For details about scaling a running space cluster **in runtime** see the [Elastic Processing Unit](./elastic-processing-unit.html) section.

{{% anchor Walkthrough %}}

## Walkthrough - the Routing Index applied to the Message Object

As you may recall from [step 2 of this tutorial](./step-two-creating-the-hello-world-application.html), the @SpaceRouting annotation decorates the getId() method of the Message object. This designates the _id_ as the **Routing Index** of the Message object. It means that when a Message object is written to the partitioned space, the return value of this method determines the partition to which the Message is written. The calculation is very simple: the hashCode() method of the return value is called, and the result is used in a modulus calculation with the number of partitions. For example, if the result of the hashCode() method call is 30, and the number of partitions is 3, then 30%3 = 0, meaning the object will be sent to the first partition.


```java
@SpaceRouting
public Integer getId() {
    return id;
}
```

#### Let's Scale our Application!

Next, we show you how to start the service grid components, by starting a grid service manager and a grid service container on each of your machines. We then deploy the processing unit with multiple instances.


{{% anchor Deploy and Run %}}

## Starting the Service Grid Components and Scaling the Application

**Steps to deploy the application:**

**Install GigaSpaces**

{{% exclamation %}} After going through the previous tutorial [Step Two - Creating the Hello World Application](./step-two-creating-the-hello-world-application.html), you should have GigaSpaces installed and the Hello World sample application environment set. If not, please [download GigaSpaces and set up your development environment](./installation-guide.html) to work with GigaSpaces - this is needed to run the tutorial sample application.

{{% anchor Start Service Grid %}}

#### Starting the Service Grid Components

1. Start **GigaSpaces Management Center (GS-UI)** by running `<GigaSpaces Root>/bin/gs-ui.bat(.sh)`.
1. Start a **GigaSpaces Agent (GSA)** by running `<GigaSpaces Root>/bin/gs-agent.(sh/bat)`.
The GSA, by default, will start 2 local Grid Service Containers, and manage a global Grid Service Manager and a global Lookup Service.

{{%accordion%}}
{{%accord title="What is a GigaSpaces Agent..."%}}
{{% panel   %}}

**The GigaSpaces Agent**

[The GigaSpaces Agent (GSA)](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsa) acts as a process manager that can spawn and manage Service Grid processes (Operating System level processes) such as the Grid Service Manager (aka [The GigaSpaces Manager](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsm)), the Grid Service Container (aka [The GigaSpaces Container](/product_overview/service-grid.html#gsc)), and Lookup Service.

{{% /panel %}}
{{%/accord%}}
{{%/accordion%}}

A new Grid Service Manager starts on your local machine, and its output can be viewed by clicking its name **gsm-1** inside the **Hosts** tab.
A new Grid Service Containers start on your local machine, and its output can be viewed by clicking their names **gsc-1**/**gsc-2** inside the **Hosts** tab.
The Grid Service Manger automatically detects the Grid Service Containers. Now we have a Service Grid with one manager and two containers up and running!

1. Start one more local **Grid Service Container**, by right-clicking **gsa-1** in the **Hosts** tab and selecting **Start GSC**.
The Service Grid now has 3 **Grid Service Containers**.

{{% sub %}}(The Service Grid Components started here are _local_ services, all running on your own machine. Naturally, in a production environment, you start them on separate machines, using the startup scripts that the product provides.){{% /sub %}}

#### Deploying with 3 Processing Unit Instances

{{% anchor Configure Scale 3 and Build %}} **Configuring the application to be partitioned over 3 instances**

1. Edit the processor's  **pu.xml** configuration file located under `<GigaSpaces root>/examples/helloworld/processor/src/META-INF/spring` folder.
1. Uncomment, or add the following SLA bean definition, which contains the deployment configuration, to the **pu.xml** file:


```xml
<os-sla:sla
	cluster-schema="partitioned-sync2backup"
	number-of-instances="3"
	max-instances-per-vm="1">
</os-sla:sla>
```

1. Build the processor Processing Unit by running `<Example Root>/build.bat(.sh) dist`.
This compiles the processor into a JAR file, ready for deployment located under `<Example Root>/Processor/PU/hello-processor.jar`.

{{% anchor Deploy 3 %}}
**Deploy the Hello World Processor as a partition of 3 instances**

1. Click the **Deploy Processing Unit Button** ![deploy_processing_unit_button.jpg](/attachment_files/deploy_processing_unit_button.jpg) to open the **Deployment Wizard** dialog.
1. Click the **Processing Unit** field **...** button to browse for the processing unit JAR file.
1. Browse to the **hello-processor.jar** JAR file, located at `<Example Root>/Processor/PU` folder and select it.
1. Click the **Deploy** button, to deploy and wait for the processing unit instances to be provisioned to the running Grid Service Containers.

#### Running the Feeder

1. Start the feeder by running `<Example root>/build.bat(.sh) run-feeder`

  {{% anchor Output 3 %}}

#### Expected output

Our Service Grid consists of 3 Grid Service Containers(GSCs). The brackets contain the process id of the gsc, Each gsc contains a Processing Unit instance that stores and processes one third of the objects. The **gsc-1**,**gsc-2** and **gsc-5** in the **Hosts** tab in Figure 9 below show the output of each Processing Unit instance. Select one of them to see its expected output.

{{% anchor Undeploy %}}

#### Undeploying the 3-Instance Deployment

Before deploying the application with a backup, we first undeploy the currently running configuration:

1. In the **Deployed Processing Unit**tab, under the **Processing Units** tree, right click the **hello-processor** deployment and click **Undeploy**.
1. Click **Yes** to approve.


#### Deploying with 2 Primary and 2 Backup Instances

{{% anchor Configure Scale 2backup and Build %}}
**Configuring scaling to be partitioned over 2 instances, with 1 backup each**

1. Edit the processor's  **pu.xml** configuration file located under `<GigaSpaces root>/examples/helloworld/processor/src/META-INF/spring` folder.
1. Uncomment, or add the following SLA bean definition, which contains the deployment configuration, to the **pu.xml** file (the number-of-backups sets the number of backups per instance):


```xml
<os-sla:sla
	cluster-schema="partitioned-sync2backup"
	number-of-instances="2"
	number-of-backups="1"
	max-instances-per-vm="1">
</os-sla:sla>
```

1. Build the processor Processing Unit by running `<Example Root>/build.bat(.sh) dist`.
This compiles the processor into a JAR file, ready for deployment located under `<Example Root>/Processor/PU/hello-processor.jar`.

{{% anchor Deploy 2 with backup %}}
**Deploy the Hello World Processor with 2 Primary and 2 Backup Instances**

1. Start one more local **Grid Service Containers**, by right-clicking **gsa-1** in the **Hosts** tab and selecting **Start GSC**. The Service Grid should now have 4 Grid Service Containers.
1. Click the **Deploy Processing Unit Button** ![deploy_processing_unit_button.jpg](/attachment_files/deploy_processing_unit_button.jpg) to open the **Deployment Wizard** dialog.
1. Click the **Processing Unit** field **...** button to browse for the processing unit JAR file.
1. Browse to the **hello-processor.jar** JAR file located at `<Example Root>/Processor/PU` folder and select it.
1. Click the **Deploy** button, to deploy and wait for the processing unit instances to be provisioned to the running Grid Service Containers.

#### Running the Feeder

1. Start the feeder by running `<Example root>/build.bat(.sh) run-feeder`.

#### Expected Output for the 2 Primary and 2 Backup Instances Deployment

Our Service Grid consists of 4 Grid Service Containers. When deploying the application, 2 primary instances and 2 backup instances (a total of 4 instances) are automatically provisioned among the 4 available Grid Service Containers.


The naming convention used for such deployments is: `<Processing unit name>.PU.<partition ID> [<backup ID> (if relevant)]`. Since the mode of a certain Processing Unit instance can change over time, you can determine whether it's actually in primary or backup mode by checking the mode of the space contained in it. This can be done by clicking the **+** sign to the left of the Processing Unit name, to view the space inside it.  The icon ![space_primary2.gif](/attachment_files/space_primary2.gif) represents a space in primary mode, and the icon ![space_backup3.gif](/attachment_files/space_backup3.gif) represents a space in backup mode. When a Processing Unit instance contains an embedded space, its mode (primary/backup) is determined by that of the space.
In the **GSC* and *GSC-1** tabs in the UI, you can see the Grid Service Containers hosting the primary Processing Units instances. We can see their outputs: each one processes its own subset of the objects.

{{% anchor Test Failover %}}

#### Testing Failover and Self-Healing

To test failover, you manually shutdown one of the Grid Service Containers that runs a primary instance. This simulates a failure in the system:

1. To see the failover process in action, prepare to click the **Hosts** root inside the **Hosts** tab after doing the following action: Locate one of the **gsc** that shows the processor output (select it in the **hosts** tab) - this indicates that this gsc is running a primary Processing Unit instance. Right-click the gsc in the **hosts** tab, choose **Terminate** from the pop-up menu and select **yes** to terminate the gsc.
1. After doing the above, quickly select the **hosts** root in the **hosts** tab to see the failover process in action.
The backup instance of the primary you just shut down becomes the primary. Then a new Processing Unit instance instantiated in another container, itself becomes the backup of the new primary.
