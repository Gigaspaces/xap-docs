<h1>Connections View</h1>
  

<p>The Connections view exposes information regarding all connected and disconnected space proxies.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>It is also possible to retrieve space connections using the <a href="space-gigaspaces-cli.htm">space connections</a> command</p>
</div>

<p>The following properties are exposed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Server IP address and port</li>
<li>Client IP address and port</li>
<li>Start connection time</li>
<li>Connection status</li>
<li>Disconnection time</li>
</ul>

<p>The Connections view is accessible for each space node. The red highlighted rows in the screenshot below are disconnected connections.</p>

<div class="tc-align-center"><p><img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/Connections View1.gif" alt="Connections View1.gif" /></p>
</div>

<p>You can clean the displayed disconnections and view only live connections by clicking the <span class="tc-bold">Clean disconnections</span> button on the top right.</p>

<h1><a name="refresh-options">&#160;</a>Refresh Options</h1>

<p>You can choose to refresh the Connection view periodically. Select the desired refresh rate from the drop-down menu. To stop automatically refreshing the Connections view, click the <span class="tc-bold">Stop* button. The refresh activity impacts server performance, so when running benchmarks you might want to stop auto-refresh activity (by clicking the *Stop</span> button). When auto-refresh is running, a green blinking dot is displayed on the right side of the screen.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>Connections are created for a space <span class="tc-bold">only when a space operation (eg. ping, write, etc.) is invoked</span>.</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Information relates only to physical (live) connections. Logical connections will be shown in the future.</li>
<li>Disconnected connections are calculated and displayed only on the client side and are not supplied by MBean methods.</li>
</ul>
