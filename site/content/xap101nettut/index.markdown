[Installation](./installation.html)<br>
You will learn   how to download and install XAP.


[XAP in 5 minutes](./dotnet-your-first-data-grid-application.html)<br>
This tutorial explains how to deploy and use a XAP [Data Grid](/product_overview/the-in-memory-data-grid.html) from a .NET client application.

[Interacting with the Space](./net-tutorial-part1.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will demonstrate how to create a Space and how you can interact with it. We will also demonstrate how you can improve your space search performance by using indexes and returning partial results.

[Deploying a Space](./net-tutorial-part2.html)<br>
In the previous section  you have learned about XAP's capabilities as a data store. In this part of the tutorial we will show you how you can deploy an In Memory Data Grid (IMDG) that provides scalability and failover.

[Processing Services](./net-tutorial-part3.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will introduce you to the different processing services you can run on top of the Space.

[Events and Messaging](./net-tutorial-part4.html)<br>
The Space’s Messaging and Events support provides messaging handlers that simplify event driven programming.

[The Processing Unit](./net-tutorial-part5.html)<br>
The PU is the fundamental unit of deployment in XAP. The PU itself runs within a Processing Unit Container and is deployed onto the Service Grid. Once a PU is deployed, a PU instance is the actual runtime entity.

[Space Transactions](./net-tutorial-part6.html)<br>
In this part of the tutorial we will introduce you to the transaction processing capabilities of XAP.


[Space Persistence](./net-tutorial-part7.html)<br>
There are many situations where space data needs to be persisted to permanent storage and retrieved from it.
