        <h1>Administering the Service Grid</h1>
        <p>The service grid, or runtime environment, is responsible for materializing the Processing Unit’s configuration, provisioning its instances to the runtime infrastructure, and making sure the instances continue to run properly over time. Administrators need to monitor the service grid to ensure that processes are running smoothly and to troubleshoot problematic behavior. The administration tools enable users to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Monitor physical and virtual (host) resources</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>View and manage containers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>View activity and event logs</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Generate dump files for investigation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Start and stop Grid Service Agents</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
