        <p>The <a href="[%=Links.ApiJavaDoc%]/org/openspaces/core/GigaSpace.html" target="_blank">GigaSpace.change</a> and the <a href="[%=Links.ApiJavaDoc%]/index.html" target="_blank">ChangeSet</a> allows updating existing objects in Space, by specifying only the required change instead of passing the entire updated object.</p>

        <p>The <code>GigaSpace.change</code> and the <code>ChangeSet</code>  allow updating existing objects in the Space, by specifying only the required change instead of passing the entire updated object.
This reduces the required network traffic between the client and the Space, and the network traffic generated from replicating changes between Space instances (for example, between the primary Space instance and its backup).</p>
        <div class="tc-align-center">
            <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/change-api.jpg" alt="" title="" class="tc-picture80" />
        </div>
        <p>Moreover, using this API also can prevent having to read the existing object prior to the change operation, because the change operation can specify how to change the existing property without knowing its current value. For instance, implementing atomic <a href="the-space-counters.html">Counters</a> can be done by increasing a counter property of an integer property by some delta. Another example is adding a value to a collection.
The change API supports <a href="transaction-overview.html">transactions</a> in the same way the other Space operation supports it, using a transactional <code>GigaSpace</code> instance.</p>
        <h1><a name="example"></a>Example</h1>
        <p>The following example demonstrates how to increment by one the <code>count</code> property of an object of type <code>WordCount</code>, with ID <code>myID</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-java">GigaSpace space = // ... obtain a space reference
String id = "myID";
IdQuery&lt;WordCount&gt; idQuery = new IdQuery&lt;WordCount&gt;(WordCount.class, id, routing);
space.change(idQuery, new ChangeSet().increment("count", 1));
</code></pre>
        <h1><a name="query-template"></a>Query Template</h1>
        <p>The change operation can receive any <a href="querying-the-space.html">query template</a> for matching a single object or multiple objects that need to be changed by the operation.</p>
        <h1><a name="change-set"></a>Change Set</h1>
        <p>The change operation requires a <a href="[%=Links.ApiJavaDoc%]/index.html" target="_blank">ChangeSet</a> that describes the changes that have to be made after locating the object specified by the query template.
The ChangeSet contains a predefined set of operations that can be invoked to alter the object. The set can contain one or more changes that will be applied sequentially to the object.
Each specified change can operate on any level of properties of the specified object. This is defined by specifying the path to the property that needs to be changed, where ".' in the path specifies
that this change is done on a nested property. For instance:</p><pre><code class="language-java">@SpaceClass
public class Account
{
  ...
  @SpaceId
  Uuid getId();
  Balance getBalance();
  void setBalance(Balance balance){...}
}

public class Balance
{
  private double euro;
  private double usDollar;
  ...
  public double getEuro();
  public void setEuro(double euro) { this.euro = euro; }
  public double getUsDollar();
  public void setUsDollar(double usDollar) { this.usDollar = usDollar; }
}
</code></pre><pre><code class="language-java">GigaSpace space = // ... obtain a space reference
Uuid id = ...;
IdQuery&lt;Account&gt; idQuery = new IdQuery&lt;Account&gt;(Account.class, id, routing);
space.change(idQuery, new ChangeSet().increment("balance.euro", 5.2D));
</code></pre>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>When using <code>changeSet</code> with <code>idQuery</code>, use a specific class type. The query must use a unique ID and return only one object in order for the API to perform the change correctly.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="specifying-the-path"></a>Specifying the Path</h2>
        <p>Each operation in the change set acts on a specified string path. This path points to the property that needs to be changed, and has the following semantic:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">First level property</span> - A path with no "." character in it points to a first-level property. If the property specified by this path is not part of the object, it is treated as a dynamic property (see <a href="dynamic-properties.html">Dynamic Properties</a>). If the object doesn't support dynamic properties, an exception is generated.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">Nested property</span> - A path that contains a "." character is considered a path to a nested property. The location process of the final property that needs to be changed is done recursively by activating the properties, specified by the split of the path using the "." character, one at a time until reaching the targeted end property.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">Nested Map property</span> - A path that contains a "." character may also point to keys inside a map, meaning the following path - "attributes.color" looks for a key named "color" if the property named "attribute" in the object is actually a map. This affects nested properties as well.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The following demonstrates how the path works with a map property instead of concrete properties:</p><pre><code class="language-java">@SpaceClass
public class Account
{
  ...
  @SpaceId
  Uuid getId();
  Map&lt;String, double&gt; getBalance();
  void setBalance(Map&lt;String, double&gt;  balance){...}
}
</code></pre><pre><code class="language-java">GigaSpace space = // ... obtain a space reference
Uuid id = ...;
IdQuery&lt;Account&gt; idQuery = new IdQuery&lt;Account&gt;(Account.class, id, routing);
space.change(idQuery, new ChangeSet().increment("balance.euro", 5.2D));
</code></pre>
        <p>In this case, the key <code>euro</code> inside the map behind the balance will be increased by 5.2.</p>

        <p>Multiple changes can be applied in one <code>change</code> operation by setting up multiple operations in the change set. Do this by chaining the changes as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-java">GigaSpace space = // ... obtain a space reference

space.change(idQuery, new ChangeSet().increment("someIntProperty", 1)

        <p>By default, the change operation doesn't modify the existing remaining lease of the changed entries. In order to change the lease, a new lease should be specified in the <code>ChangeSet</code> using the <code>lease</code> operation.</p><pre><code class="language-java">GigaSpace space = // ... obtain a space reference
space.change(idQuery, new ChangeSet().lease(1000)...);

        <p>The lease can be changed as part of other changes applied to the object, or the <code>ChangeSet</code> can include only the lease modification without any property changes.</p>
        <p>The lease time specified will override the existing lease with the new value, relative to the current time, while ignoring the current lease.</p>
        <p>The above example sets the lease of the changed object to one second from the time the change operation takes effect.</p>
        <h1><a name="change-with-timeout"></a>Change with Timeout</h1>
        <p>A timeout can be passed to the <code>change</code> operation. This timeout will only be used if any of the objects to be changed is locked under a transaction that is not from the current thread context. In this case, all objects that are not locked are  changed, and the operation is blocked until one of the following two events happens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The transaction lock is released - in this case, the change operation is applied on the objects that were previously locked but are now available.</li>
            <li>A timeout occurs - in this case, the change operation returns with an exception. Like all other failures, the exception is a <code>ChangeException</code> that contains the successful changes. All the objects that were still locked when the timeout period elapsed are part of the <code>getFailedChanges</code> property of the exception, each with a failure reason of <code>UpdateOperationTimeoutException</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there are no matching objects for the specified template/query, the operation returns immediately without waiting for the timeout to elapse.

        <h1><a name="spacesynchronizationendpoint"></a>SpaceSynchronizationEndpoint</h1>
        <p>A SpaceSynchronizationEndpoint implementation can support change operations, and make use of lighter replication between the Space and the mirror.
For more information on how to implement this, refer to the <a href="change-api-advanced.html">Advanced Implementations</a> topic.</p>
        <h1><a name="replication-filter"></a>Replication Filter</h1>
        <p>Change passes through the <a href="../admin/cluster-replication-filters.html">Replication Filter</a> like other operations, and can be discarded on the replication level, for example.</p>

        <h1><a name="add-and-get-operations"></a>Add and Get Operations</h1>
        <p>A common usage pattern is to increment a numeric property of a specific entry, and then to need the updated value after the increment was applied.
Using the <code>addAndGet</code> operation, you can meet this need using a single method call to get atomic add and get operation semantics.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of incrementing a property called <code>counter</code> inside an entry of type <code>WordCount</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-java">GigaSpace space = // ... obtain a space reference
Uuid id = ...;
IdQuery&lt;WordCount&gt; idQuery = new IdQuery&lt;WordCount&gt;(WordCount.class, id, routing);
Integer newCounter = ChangeExtension.addAndGet(space, idQuery, "counter", 1);
</code></pre>
        <p>You should use the primitive wrapper types, as the operation semantic is to return null if there is no object matching the provided ID query.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>You can use <code>import static org.openspaces.extensions.ChangeExtension.</code> so that you don't have to prefix the call with `ChangeExtension'.</p>
        </div>
        <h1><a name="considerations"></a>Considerations</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>If replicated to a gateway and a conflict occurs, the change operation only supports the built-in <code>abort</code> resolution as <code>override</code> in change case may result with an inconsistent state of the object.</li>
            <li>The change operation is converted to a regular update when delegated to a synchronous data source.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><a name="limitations"></a>Limitations</h1>
        <p><code>rownum</code>   is not supported with the Changeset SQLQuery operation.</p>
