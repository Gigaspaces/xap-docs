        <h1>Network Monitoring</h1>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Some of the features discussed on this page are not part of the open-source edition, and are only available in the licensed editions (starting with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAPPrem" />).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Monitoring network and usage activity during runtime gives you the ability to track which client is invoking which methods on each service (e.g a space serving remote client request such as read/write). Which can be very useful to identify issues, such as which remote proxy is causing a high load on a specific space. Or investigating version conflicts and so on. This monitoring exposes the details for both inbound and outbound communication, allowing you to track the activity of the remote clients on services hosted on a specific Jvm, or alternatively track the activity of the proxies in a specific Jvm on remote services.</p>
        <h1><a name="enabling-lrmi-monitoring"></a>Enabling LRMI Monitoring</h1>
        <p>The monitoring itself is not enabled by default since it introduces some overhead (though not significant) to the system which needs to monitor and track and incoming and outgoing lrmi invocations. In order to enable the monitoring there are three ways to do so:</p>
        <h2><a name="system-property"></a>System Property</h2>
        <p>Up front by providing a system property when starting the relevant components (gs-agent, Grid service Manager/Container) - the following system property "com.gs.transport_protocol.lrmi.monitorActivity=true' should be set in order to do so.</p>
        <h2><a name="api"></a>API</h2>
        <p>Using the Admin API during runtime you can enable or disable the LRMI monitoring, for example enabling LRMI monitoring for Jvms hosting a specific processing unit.</p><pre><code class="language-java">Admin admin = new AdminFactory().addGroup("myGroup").createAdmin();

// wait a bit for components to be discovered (or use waitFor) ...

ProcessingUnit processingUnit = admin.getProcessingUnits().waitFor("myProcesingUnit");

// wait for all instances
processingUnit.waitFor(processingUnit.getNumberOfInstances());

for(ProcessingUnitInstance puInstance : processingUnit)
{
  puInstance.getTransport().getLRMIMonitoring().enableMonitoring();
}
</code></pre>
        <h2><a name="jmx"></a>JMX</h2>
        <p>For GSC that contains a space instance, you can also access the GSC via JMX using JConsole for instance and enable or disable the LRMI monitoring as shown in the image.</p>
        <div class="tc-align-center">
            <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/jmx-lrmi-monitoring.jpg" alt="jmx-lrmi-monitoring.jpg" class="tc-picture100" />
        </div>
        <p>Note that when enabling it via JMX it will enable the monitoring for the entire Jvm and not just the space that was used to enable the monitoring.</p>
        <h1><a name="retrieving-lrmi-monitoring-details"></a>Retrieving LRMI Monitoring Details</h1>
        <p>There are three ways to retrieve the LRMI monitoring details, all of which requires that the relevant Jvm will have the LRMI monitoring enabled which as done as described previously.</p>
        <h2><a name="using-dump"></a>Using Dump</h2>
        <p>When generating a <a href="../dev-java/dump.html">Dump</a> and the LRMI monitoring is enabled if the network dump is selected then the dump will include the LRMI monitoring details. When generating the dump it should include the <code>Network Dump</code> in it in order to contain the LRMI monitoring details. In the generated dump the "network.txt' file will include, among other things, the LRMI monitoring details and it will look similar to this:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">===== LRMI =====

        <h2><a name="api-1"></a>API</h2>
        <p>Using the Admin API, you can retrieve the monitoring details as typed classes, following the above example you can get LRMI monitoring of Jvms hosting a specific processing unit.</p><pre><code class="language-java">Admin admin = new AdminFactory().addGroup("myGroup").createAdmin();

// wait a bit for components to be discovered (or use waitFor) ...

ProcessingUnit processingUnit = admin.getProcessingUnits().waitFor("myProcesingUnit");

// wait for all instances
processingUnit.waitFor(processingUnit.getNumberOfInstances());

for(ProcessingUnitInstance puInstance : processingUnit)
{
  LRMIMonitoringDetails monitoringDetails = puInstance.getTransport().getLRMIMonitoring().fetchMonitoringDetails();
  LRMIOutboundMonitoringDetails outboundDetails = monitoringDetails.getOutboundMonitoringDetails();
  LRMIInboundMonitoringDetails inboundDetails = monitoringDetails.getInboundMonitoringDetails();
  // ... do something with the details
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The details included by API are exactly the same as shown in the network dump, as a matter of fact, the network dump is simply the <code>toString()</code> of the <code>LRMIMonitoringDetails</code> class</p>
        <h2><a name="jmx-1"></a>JMX</h2>
        <p>JMX can also be accessed to get the details, however in a digested string format which looks like the content of the network dump file, this can be done via JConsole in the same way you enable the LRMI monitoring, you invoke the <code>fetchMonitoringDetails</code> operation instead.</p>
        <h1><a name="monitoring-content"></a>Monitoring Content</h1>
        <p>As showed in the above dump file, the monitoring details contains the following:</p>
        <p><span class="tc-bold">Inbound</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>List of hosted service their details and inbound invocation details.</li>
            <li>Per service, showing details of each connected remote client invocation details, including its address, version etc'.</li>
            <li>client invocation details including information about which methods were invoked by the client, network traffic generated by the client etc'.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="tc-bold">Outbound</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>List of proxies and their details and outbound invocation details.</li>
            <li>Per proxy, showing invocation details including information about which methods were invoked by the client, network traffic generated by the client etc'.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The monitoring details contains only data for active client, there history is not preserved. Which means that inbound invocations of clients that are no longer connected to the server or outbound invocations of proxies that do no longer exist will not be part of the monitoring details. In order to track history one need to actively collect the monitoring details and persist them somewhere else.
However, keep in mind that getting the details all the time require the LRMI monitoring to be enabled throughout the entire monitoring period. And fetching the details themselves may introduce network overhead when there are many clients involved.</p>
