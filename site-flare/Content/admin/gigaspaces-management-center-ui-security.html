        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>GigaSpaces Management Center (UI) allows to manage the Grid services and Processing Units running within the Grid containers. When security is enabled, the UI will restrict access to these services for non-privileged users.</p>
        <p>Administrators can use the UI to manage users and roles, and allow them to Login and operate based on their granted privileges.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-refer">
            <p>This section assumes familiarity with the <a href="../security/security-concepts.html">Security Basics</a> section.</p>
        </div>
        <h1><a name="managing-users-and-roles"></a>Managing Users and Roles</h1>
        <p>Managing the directory can be done directly through the <code>DirectoryManager</code> API. GigaSpaces Management Center utilizes this API and exposes a convenient administration interface for managing the users and roles supported by the backed directory implementation.</p>
        <p>Our default file-based implementation allows the directory to be administered only if the user has <span class="tc-bold">Manage Users</span> or <span class="tc-bold">Manage Roles</span> privileges. When the directory is first created (i.e. directory file doesn't exist), only an <code>admin/admin</code> user may be allowed to access and administer the directory. By default, the <code>admin</code> holds both privileges which allows declaring of new roles, adding users and assigning of roles. The <code>admin</code> user can be deleted, as long as you provide another user with management capabilities.</p>
        <h2><a name="security-management-dialog"></a>Security Management dialog</h2>
        <p>There is no need for any service to be up and running. Just choose from the title menu bar

            <li>
                <p><code>Use Default Configuration</code> - The defaults of the underlying implementation.
For example, the file-based implementation's defaults are to access/create a file located under <code><MadCap:variable name="General.HomePath" />/security/gs-directory.fsm</code>.</p>

                <p><code>Administrator username and password</code>- A user with <code>Manage Roles or Manage Users</code> privileges.
For first time usage of the file-based implementation, use <code>admin/admin</code> - This will create a new file with the <code>admin</code> user which only has directory management privileges.</p>

        <h1><a name="login-logout"></a>Login/Logout</h1>
        <p>There are two options to perform UI login - directly from the command line or from within the UI.</p>
        <p>You may find the command line option convenient when using pre-defined scripts. Use the command line arguments <code>-user</code> and <code>-password</code> with the user credentials.
Usage:</p><pre><code class="language-java">gs-ui(.sh/.bat) -user user -password password
</code></pre>
        <h2><a name="login-dialog"></a>Login dialog</h2>
        <p>To login from within the UI, choose from the title menu bar

            <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/login-dialog.png" alt="login-dialog.png" class="tc-picture30" />
        </p>
        <p>In distributed systems, the login credentials are authenticated with each service. Thus, the indication of success or failure is specific to each.
The <code>Authentication Monitor</code>* dialog appears when you press the <span class="tc-bold">OK</span> button, but can also be viewed when pressing the <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/logged-in-as.png" alt="logged-in-as.png" class="tc-pictureinline" /> icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen (appears after Login).</p>

                <p>A service which has yet been logged into, or login has failed for, will appear as locked <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/locked.png" alt="locked.png" style="width: 11px; height: 15px;" class="tc-pictureinline" /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A service for which authentication was successful will be indicated as unlocked <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/un-locked.png" class="tc-pictureinline" style="width: 15px;height: 21px;" /></p>
            </li>
