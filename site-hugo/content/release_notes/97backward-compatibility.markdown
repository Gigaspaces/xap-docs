## Overview
Backward Compatibility in GigaSpaces
XAP 9.7 is a minor release which includes new features and improvements, including the Change API, Custom Eviction Policy and more.

We try to maintain backward compatibility wherever possible. However, in some cases, no backward compatibility is provided.

{{%note%}}
As a best practice, when upgrading to GigaSpaces 9.7, unzip the latest version of GigaSpaces 9.7 and port the necessary changes from your pre-9.7 environment into your new 9.7 environment. It is recommended to use the GigaSpaces 9.7 distribution as-is. Please refer to the  Upgrade Guide for more details.
