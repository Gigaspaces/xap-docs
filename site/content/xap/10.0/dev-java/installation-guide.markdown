# Java Installation
Download the latest version of XAP from the [downloads page](http://www.gigaspaces.com/xap-download). Unzip it into a directory of your choice:

gshome-directory
* On Windows, you might unzip it into `c:\tools\`, which will create `c:\tools\{{%version "gshome-directory"%}}`.

gshome-directory
* On Unix, you might unzip it into `/usr/local/`, which will create `/usr/local/{{%version "gshome-directory"%}}`. You'll also need to grant execution permissions to the scripts in the bin folder.



#### JAVA_HOME
Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the JDK root directory

#### Installing a Java IDE
If you don't have an IDE installed, you can [download and unzip the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads), or the [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) IDE (we recommend the Ultimate Edition because of its excellent Spring framework support).
If you're using Eclipse, it is also recommended to install the [Spring Tool Suite plugin for Eclipse](http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts).

#### Setting up your IDE

gshome-directory
Open your favorite java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc), Create a new project, and add all the jars from `{{%version "gshome-directory"%}}/lib/required` to the project's classpath.

# .NET installation

GigaSpaces XAP.NET is packaged as a standard Windows Installer package (.msi file). After you have downloaded the latest version of XAP from the [downloads page](http://www.gigaspaces.com/xap-download), start the installation by double-click the msi file, and the installation wizard will pop up and guide you through the installation process.

Once you accept the licence agreement, you will be asked to choose a setup type. Select 'Complete' to install all the features in the default path (C:\GigaSpaces\XAP.NET X.x.x). Selecting 'Custom' will allow you to customize the installation path, which features will be installed, and more.
