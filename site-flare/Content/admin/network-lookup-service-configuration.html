        <p>Defining group names and unicast Locators for Jini Services; searching for available lookup services in the network.</p>
        <h1><a name="essential-guidelines"></a>Essential Guidelines</h1>
        <p><span class="tc-bold">It is essential to set the <code>groups</code> and <code>locators</code> system properties in the Java process which starts the Lookup Service or Mahalo services</span>. This is required in order to "tell" the Jini service which groups and locators it should join, and which to serve. If these properties are not set, the Lookup Service/Mahalo uses the Jini fallback values and that impact the SLA these services serve with.</p>
        <p><span class="tc-bold">Do not have more than two Jini Lookup Services across one site</span> - having the <code>space-instance</code> running a Jini Lookup Service embedded by default can cause problems. As a result of not have more than two Jini Lookup Services across one site, spaces do not have to deal with registering themselves into too many Jini Lookup Services, and the Space Browser's freezing behavior is reduced.</p>
        <p><span class="tc-bold">Jini groups vs. locators</span> - Jini groups are irrelevant when using unicast lookup discovery - they are relevant only when using multicast lookup discovery. If you have multiple spaces with the same name and you are using unicast lookup discovery, you might end up getting the wrong proxy.</p>
        <p>In such a case, make sure you have a different lookup group for each space, where each space is configured to use a specific lookup. A good practice is to have different space/service names.</p>

            <p>When using multicast please review the following section <a href="network-multicast-is-available.html">How to Determine Whether Multicast is Available</a> and <a href="network-multicast.html">How to Configure Multicast</a>.</p>

        <h1><a name="setting-up-the-lookup-service-for-multicast-discovery-using-lookup-group"></a>Setting up the Lookup Service For Multicast Discovery (Using Lookup Group)</h1>
        <p>Each of the Jini Services (such as the Reggie lookup service or the Mahalo Transaction Manager) registers and advertises using a group name which is defined by the following system property (set in the <code>/bin/setenv.bat file</code>):</p><pre><code>set <MadCap:variable name="General.EnvVariablePrefix" />_LOOKUP_GROUPS="gigaspaces-%USERNAME%"
set LOOKUP_GROUPS_PROP=-Dcom.gs.jini_lus.groups=%<MadCap:variable name="General.EnvVariablePrefix" />_LOOKUP_GROUPS%
</code></pre>
        <p>While the <code>%USERNAME%</code> will be replaced after installation with the version number e.g.
set <code><MadCap:variable name="General.EnvVariablePrefix" />_LOOKUP_GROUPS="gigaspaces-insightedge-enterprise-14.2-ga"</code>.</p>
        <p>The command that loads a space needs to have this system property set. Another way of doing it instead of setting the <code>com.gs.jini_lus.groups</code> system property, is to set the Space URL groups attribute, e.g.:</p><pre><code class="language-java">/./mySpace?schema=cache&amp;groups=myPrivateGroupName
