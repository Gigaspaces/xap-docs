        <p>This part of the system allows you to create and execute low code data services. A query service will trigger a space query every time a request is made. </p>
        <h1>Service Creator</h1>
        <p>ServiceCreator service, which exposes the REST&#160;endpoints, is deployed in the environment via the Kubernetes orchestration. Any new service creation request generates a new resource of the kind QueryService by submitting a request to the ServiceCreator service. Via the SpringBoot REST&#160;application, ServiceCreator service exposes the following APIs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Create Query Service given Spec.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Get service spec-parameters given its ID.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Get list of available services of this kind (queryService).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Delete service.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>View List of Services</h1>
        <p>The main screen displays a list of services. &#160;For our example, there have been three services created which have different statuses:</p>

        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>The ServiceCreator service, which exposes REST endpoints, is deployed in the environment. &#160;In addition, the ServiceCreator operator is deployed. A new service request generates a new resource of type QueryService by submitting a request to the ServiceCreator service.
