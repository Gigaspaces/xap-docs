<h1>Transactions</h1>
  

<p>XAP's JMS implementation uses transactions to implement the <code>Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode and transacted sessions.</p>

<p>When using <code>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode, messages are consumed in a transaction, and sent without a transaction.</p>

<p>The transaction is committed only when the client calls <code>Message.acknowledge()</code>, acknowledging the consumed messages.</p>

<p>Transacted sessions use transactions to consume and to send messages. When the client calls <code>Session.commit()</code>, unacknowledged messages are acknowledged and produced messages are written to the space.</p>

<h1><a name="local-vs-distributed-transactions">&#160;</a>Local vs. Distributed Transactions</h1>

<p>In GigaSpaces JMS, it is possible to use local transactions and distributed transactions (Mahalo).</p>

<p>In general, using local transactions is more efficient than using distributed transactions.</p>

<p>The only limitation when using local transactions relates to the fact that a transaction is valid only for a single space. This is problematic, because GigaSpaces routs JMS messages to the spaces according to the destination name. A message to a Queue named <code>myQueue1</code> might arrive at <code>space1</code>, while another message to a Queue named <code>myQueue2</code> might arrive at <code>space2</code>. If a client uses a local transaction to send the two messages, it might get a <code>TransactionException</code>.</p>

<p>To overcome this problem, the client can use distributed transactions, that can span over more than one space.</p>

<h2><a name="when-to-use-distributed-transactions">&#160;</a>When to Use Distributed Transactions</h2>

<p>The JMS client uses a cluster that contains more than one space. The session is transacted, and transactions involve more than one destination (for message consumption and/or production):</p>

<ul>
<li>Consuming a message from a queue, and sending a message to another destination.</li>
<li>Sending more than one message, to more than one destination.</li>
</ul>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>You do not need to use distributed transactions when consuming from a Topic, and sending a single message to another destination.</p>
</div>

<h3><a name="preparing-jms-to-work-with-distributed-transactions">&#160;</a>Preparing JMS to Work with Distributed Transactions</h3>

<p>To use Mahalo, you must first enable the Mahalo service in GigaSpaces.</p>

<p>To enable Mahalo, set the following XPath property in the <code>&lt;XAP Root&gt;\config\gs.properties</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">com.j_spaces.core.container.embedded-services.mahalo.start-embedded-mahalo=true
</code></pre>

<p>To use Mahalo transactions in JMS transacted sessions, add the following system property:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">com.gs.jms.use_mahalo=true
</code></pre>

<div class="tc-admon-note">
  
  <p>You can avoid using distributed transactions by:</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Not involving more than one destination in a transaction.</li>
<li>Using only a single space (not a cluster).</li>
<li>Consuming messages from Topic, and sending messages to a <span class="tc-bold">single</span> destination.</li>
</ul>
