For read and take operations, XAP iterates non-null values that match template or SQLQuery criteria, returning matches from the Space. This process can be time consuming, especially when there are many potential matches. To improve performance, it is possible to index one or more Space class properties. The Space maintains additional data for indexed properties, which shortens the time required to determine a match, thus improving performance.
