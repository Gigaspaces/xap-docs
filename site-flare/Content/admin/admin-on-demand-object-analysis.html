        <h1>What Aspects of a Space Object are we Analyzing?</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />enables developers to store and manage data within a Space Object. </p>
        <p>The Space Object contains one or more Object Types, comparable to tables within a database. Object data is stored in memory, and optionally on disk, as configured by the system administrator.</p>
        <p>Based on the properties of each Object Type, and the number of occurrences of each property, On Demand Object Analysis calculates the amount of memory stored within a Space Object. In addition, it calculates the memory footprint of the object indexes.</p>
        <p>A comparison is also made between these values and the total amount of memory allocated to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> cluster and its partitions.</p>
        <p>Two or more Object Analyses can be compared, to spot trends of increasing or decreasing memory consumption.
        </p>
        <p>This process is done after initial provisioning and load of sample data, and is on-going while new services are deployed and additional data is stored within the space.</p>
        <p>One use of On Demand Object Analysis is by developers when deploying new services, to determine memory usage. It can be done in a separated staging environment or as part of the initial data load.</p>
        <p>Administrators can use object analysis on a daily or weekly basis, to analyze for system health and determine the memory usage for the entire Space Object or for specific object types. It is possible to analyze the data size at the partition level, to identify cases where a specific partition is overloaded with data that could potentially impact its performance.</p>

        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Although  Object Analysis results are a close approximation of memory usage, some variations may exist between the reported results and the exact amount of memory used. </p>

        <h1>How Do I Perform an Object Analysis?</h1>
        <div title="GigaSpaces Ops Manager" style="padding:10px">
            <p>Trigger an Object Analysis by pressing the <b>Run Objects Analysis</b> button on the Ops Manager <b>Analysis</b>screen, and choosing which partition to analyze. </p>

            </p>
            <p>A dialog box will display, asking for a confirmation of the analysis request:</p>

            <div class="tc-admon-attention">
                <p>Because the Object analysis process may consume considerable system resources, it is recommended to run the analysis at an off-peak time, when the system is experiencing relatively low usage.</p>
            </div>
            <p>During the analysis process, the screen appears as follows:</p>

            <h1>Results of Object Analysis</h1>
            <p>When the analysis is complete, press <b>Show object analysis report</b> to view the memory usage of the Spaces, Objects, Properties and Indexes. Alternatively, you can choose the action View Latest Report from the command menu.</p>
            <div class="tc-admon-note">
                <p>If the Object analysis is not successful, press Review Logs to view determine the cause of the failure.</p>

            <p>Click on Properties to see the storage usage for the properties of the object .</p>
            <p>The Object Types analysis includes entries, RAM size, Disk Utilization, and other data for each object in the space.</p>

            <h2>Indexes Analysis</h2>
            <p>Indexes are stored within the Space and used for fast access to data stored either in-memory, and on-disk. This means that indexes compete with object type data for partition memory resources.</p>
            <p>This is why it is important to analyze index sizes and take them in consideration as part of system monitoring and future planning.</p>
            <p>Index sizes are calculated as part of object analysis run and the calculated sizes can be seen within the object types reports. Each object type contains its indexes and their calculated sizes, including the ability to compare with the previous object analysis.</p><span class="tc-textblue" style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; screen shot here of the Indexes data&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>

            <p>In the Space Details screen, two Data Distribution charts are displayed -- Entries by Partition, and Reads by Partition.</p>
