        <h1>Smart DIH&#160;Overview</h1>
        <p>GigaSpaces Smart DIH is a distributed in-memory Digital Integration Hub (DIH), with unparalleled low-latency, high-performance and scale that aggregates and offloads from multiple back-end systems of record and data stores on premise and on cloud. With a unified API layer, digital applications can be decoupled from disparate systems of record to increase agility and ensure always-on services.</p>
        <p>When an existing Operational Data Store is already deployed, Smart DIH can augment it to gain better performance, indexing, data integration and ETL replacement. It can be done by either mirroring the DIH actions to the data stores, or by using Smart DIH’s built-in Change Data Capture (CDC) that connects directly with your systems of record, non-intrusively (agentless).</p>
