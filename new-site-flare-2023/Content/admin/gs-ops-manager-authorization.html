        <h2>User Roles</h2>
        <p>InsightEdge Ops Manager provides advanced capabilities of services monitoring, data analysis, and connectivity to multiple data sources. These capabilities are divided into a list of screens and features with permissions for logging user roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Admin</b> (superuser) – has access to all capabilities including features related to services orchestration that has high impact on the environment resources consumption (e.g. scale up/down of service partitions).</li>
            <li><b>Manager</b> – can deploy one or many services and connect with client applications and other components such as databases, Kafka, etc. A Manager will deploy services, will test them – function and performance - and analyze the data behavior within the Space.</li>
            <li><b>Viewer</b> – data expert with a goal to view, interact with and query the data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Roles and Permissions in Ops Manager</h2>
        <p>The following table lists the various functionalities available in Ops Manager, based on the user's assigned role.</p>
