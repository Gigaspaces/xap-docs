The Kubernetes installation comes with a 24-hour trial `tryme` license, to enable users to perform one-click installation and explore the InsightEdge Platform and XAP functionality. However, if you want a longer trial license, you can apply the evaluation license key that you received in the email that was sent to you after you downloaded your InsightEdge or XAP commercial edition from the Download Center. These instructions are also applicable for applying a your official product license after you purchase a GigaSpaces product.

You can apply a product license in one of the following ways:

- Update the main product Helm chart
- Create a custom chart
- ???
