            <h2><a name="DIOPtion1"></a>Option 1: IIDR&#160;Agent On-Prem and&#160;DI in Kubernetes Cloud</h2>
            <p>This is the recommended deployment model for when the IIDR database source agent, such as Oracle, MSSQL, DB2, is running on-prem inside a source database server whilst all the remaining DI components are running in a Kubernetes cloud environment.</p>
            <h2>Deployment Model Prerequisites</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>VPN is configured between the on-prem deployment and AWS&#160;Kubernetes segment</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>IIDR&#160;Source Database Agent software can be installed and configured on the source database server</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There is a bi-directional working network communication between the IIDR&#160;Source Agent and the DI&#160;Components in AWS</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Option 2: All IIDR&#160;Components On-Prem and DI in a Kubernetes Cloud</h1>
            <p>This deployment model allows installation of all IIDR related resources on-premises while the rest of a DI layer should be run in a Kubernetes cloud environment.</p>
            <p>This deployment can be useful when the source database network segment cannot be accessed directly from the cloud segment. When such a network constraint is present, the IIDR AS with IIDR Kafka Agent can be installed on a local Linux server that is located on-prem and resides in a network segment that has access to the database server network.</p>

                <li>

            <h1>Option 3: IIDR&#160;with Remote Source Database Engine</h1>
            <p>This deployment model can be useful when the IIDR agent is not allowed to be installed on a source database server.  In this case the IIDR remote agent can be used in order to connect to the source database.</p>
            <p>IIDR source database remote agent is supported for:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Db2 zos database as a source</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Oracle database as a source</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>IIDR remote agent can <b>not</b> be used with:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Db2 AS-400 database as a source</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>MSSQL database as a source</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="tc-admon-important">
                <p>Oracle database log files (redo logs) should be physically accessible by the IIDR remote agent, &#160;This is achieved by ensuring the Oracle redo logs and archive files are located on a shared NFS location that can be accessed from the server where the IIDR Oracle agent is running,</p>
