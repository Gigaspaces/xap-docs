        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Product Life Cycle and End-of-Life Policy</h1>
        <p>This page explains the life cycle and End-of-Life (EOL) policy for <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> products and related third-party products, along with information about extended support, upgrading, and <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/services-offering-overview" target="_blank">available assistance</a>. The page also provides a product support roadmap to assist customers with future planning. All customers should refer to the specific service list they purchased to determine the specific level of support to which they are entitled.</p>
        <h1><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Product Life Cycle Policy</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> product life cycle policy is based on the following guidelines (unless stated otherwise in your service contract):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New policy change: For all versions, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> provides technical product support for 2 years, starting from the next upcoming public GA of the release of the relevant product version.</li>
            <li>Effective as of the official Support Discontinuance Date (2 years starting from next upcoming public GA) these versions will no longer be supported under a standard support agreement. Extended Support may be available for an additional limited period, for an extra fee. Please contact <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />' Customer Service for more information.</li>
            <li>Maintenance releases (service packs) are scheduled to be publicly available every 6-8 weeks and are driven by customer feedback. The above, is the planned schedule however does not constitute a firm commitment to produce a release at every such interval.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Backwards Compatibility</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> guarantees backwards compatibility under the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>APIs - For two major versions going forward, and/or two years after a change in functionality.</li>
            <li>Client-server compatibility - For two major versions (clients are guaranteed to work with servers running the next major version).</li>
            <li>Server-server compatibility - For service packs on the same version only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if a new feature is introduced in version 10.0 that is meant to replace an existing feature, the existing feature will be deprecated as of version 10.0, and supported through 11.x. Starting from 12.x, backwards compatibility will no longer be guaranteed for the deprecated feature.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-attention">
            <p>Backwards compatibility is <span class="tc-italic">not </span>guaranteed between server-client, where the server is running an older version and the client is running a newer version of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIEP" /> or <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="feature-levels">Feature Levels</h2>
        <p>A feature can be at one of these feature levels: <b>Alpha</b>, <b>Beta</b>, <b>Preview</b> or <b>GA</b>. Each feature level is described below.</p>
        <h3>Alpha Feature Level</h3>
        <p>A feature at Alpha level is a new feature that is introduced on an experimental or trial basis. This kind of feature may or may not be provided on a GA level in the future.</p>
        <p>Alpha-level features are disabled by default, and the feature description will explain how to enable the feature. Although tested before release, Alpha-level features may contain undocumented bugs and are used at the customer's risk. </p>
        <h3>Beta Feature Level</h3>
        <p>A feature at Beta level is a new feature that is introduced with the intention of eventually becoming a GA-level feature. This kind of feature will probably be provided on a GA level in the future.</p>
        <p>Beta-level features are disabled by default, and the feature description will explain how to enable the feature. Although well tested, this kind of feature may still contain undocumented bugs and should not be used for business-critical applications. </p>
        <h3>Preview Feature Level</h3>
        <p>A feature at Preview level is provided as an early access functionality for customer feedback. Preview features are subject to separate Supplemental Terms of Use.</p>
        <h3>GA Feature Level</h3>
        <p>A feature at GA (General Availability) level is a feature that is thoroughly documented and tested and is considered a stable part of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> system. Unless otherwise stated, a feature is at GA level. The vast majority of features are at GA level.</p>
        <h2> End-of-Life Policy</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> products may reach End of Life for a number of reasons, including product evolution due to market requirements, or replacement by more advanced versions with richer functionality.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> recognizes that end-of-life milestones can have a signification impact on the IT environment of our customers. With this in mind, we have put out a long-term end-of-life policy that is published in advance, to assist customers in  managing the transition to a newer version, and to help customers understand how <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />' Customer Service can help with migrating affected applications.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Extended Support (beyond the Support Discontinuance Date) enables you to upgrade your systems to the most recent version after the Support Discontinuance Date.
