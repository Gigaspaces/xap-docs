        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>As a solution from the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> family it contains <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> high-speed, distributed in-memory data storage and processing grid. The platform <a href="XAP-Colocated-code.html">colocates</a> applications and data, offering ultra-low latency, high-throughput transaction and stream processing. The platform offers unique capabilities that are not available in simple caching solutions, such as full SQL compatibility, multi-criteria queries, dynamic server-side processing, full data integrity, policy-driven data tiering, seamless database integration, and cloud-native deployment. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" /> ensures data consistency and reliability across distributed environments by employing ACID-compliant transactions to maintain data integrity. It uses sophisticated replication and partitioning mechanisms to ensure high availability and fault tolerance, even in the event of node failures. These features, combined with its support for SQL-99 standards, ensure that XAP Skyline can provide consistent, reliable data access and processing capabilities at scale.</p>
        <p>Typically cloud native offerings add a lot of flexibility, scalability and availability. &#160;However, this comes at a cost of latency which has a direct impact on the bottom line in terms of conversion and downtime cost. &#160;<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" /> improves database latency by bringing the critical data closer to the application into the Kubernetes cluster which improves latency by more than 90% which in turn enhances reliability and reduces costs. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" />;s architecture is specifically optimized for minimizing latency and maximizing throughput within Kubernetes environments. Its data management strategies are tailored for cloud-native applications, providing faster access to data and improving overall application responsiveness.</p>
        <p> <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" /> reduces latency by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Bringing your critical data closer to the application into the Kubernetes cluster  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Running the data in-memory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Processing the data locally, thus reducing the changes for failure, by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Collocating the data processing in the same process as the data.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Requiring no network calls or serialization overhead.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It provide a highly-reliable, distributed, in-memory storage and processing engine. Essentially, it is an <a href="../overview/the-in-memory-data-grid.html">in-memory data grid (IMDG)</a> designed to support  millisecond-level latency and millions of operations per second, providing for thousands of deployed services, and hundreds to thousands of concurrent users. This solution makes the implementation of distributed applications above the <a href="../dev-java/the-gigaspace-interface-overview.html">Space</a> simpler and less intrusive, enabling efficient building of highly scalable and highly performing applications.</p>

            <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAPSkyline" /> runs server side processing, providing the high performance of advanced operations and avoiding data retrieval back to the client side. Aggregation is performed in-memory, on relevant data only, regardless of total data size. It uses <a href="../overview/space-based-architecture.html">Space-Based Architecture</a> (SBA) as a primary design pattern. With SBA, applications are built out of a set of self-sufficient units, known as <a href="../dev-java/the-processing-unit-overview.html">Processing Units</a> (PU). These units are completely independent of each other, so that an application can scale without increasing complexity, just by adding more units. SBA is based on the Tuple Space paradigm. SBA follows many of the principles of Service-Oriented Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture, as well as elements of grid computing.</p>
