XAP provides a framework for collecting and reporting metrics from the distributed runtime environment into a metric repository of your choice. These metrics be analyzed and used to identify trends in the system behavior.

This section describes the core metrics concepts and how to [configure](./metrics-configuration.html) metrics collection. XAP contains a set of [predefined metrics](./metrics-bundled.html), and you can also create custom [user-defined metrics](./metrics-user-defined.html).

You can configure XAP to report metrics to [InfluxDB](./metrics-influxdb-reporter.html) and [CA APM Introscope](./ca-apm-introscope-reporter.html), or you can create a [custom metrics reporter](./metrics-custom-reporter.html) as per the requirements of your specific application and XAP environment.
