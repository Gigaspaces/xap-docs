# Enhanced SSD driver

When using MemoryXtend with a primary-backup topology, the backup can now recover from is local SSD instead of pulling all the data from the primary over the network, which boosts performance tremendously.

# APM Introscope Metrics Reporter

The XAP metrics framework was designed to support custom reporter implementations. In addition to the built-in InfluxDB reporter, we've now added a new reporter to integrate with [CA APM](http://www.ca.com/us/products/application-performance-management.aspx), which is a powerful product widely used in large companies to monitor applications and react quickly when certain performance issues may occur.

# Configure the Transport Layer Encryption Protocol
