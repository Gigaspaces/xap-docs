<h1>JPA Relationships</h1>
  

<p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> JPA relationships model is different than Relational Databases model. In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> relationships are owned, which means that an owner of a relationship holds the owned entities within itself in Space. For instance, if an Author has a One-to-many relationship with Book, in Space all the Book instances relevant for a specific Author will reside within a Collection in Author.</p>

<p>When defining a One-to-one/One-to-many relationship the cascading type should be set to CascadeType.ALL using the relationship's annotation cascade attribute since no-cascading is unsupported.
Setting cascading globally can also be done in orm.xml:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;persistence-unit-metadata&gt;
  &lt;persistence-unit-defaults&gt;
    &lt;cascade-persist/&gt;
  &lt;/persistence-unit-defaults&gt;
&lt;/persistence-unit-metadata&gt;
</code></pre>

<h1><a name="embedded"></a>Embedded</h1>

<p>In the following example we have a Store entity which has an embedded Address property.
In this case, the Address property is saved as is within Store.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">// An Embeddable Address object
@Embeddable
public class Address implements Serializable {
  private String street;
  private String city;
  private String country;

  public Address() {
  }

  public String getStreet() {
    return this.street;
  }

  public String getCity() {
    return this.city;
  }

  public String getCountry() {
    return this.country;
  }

  /* Additional Getters &amp; Setters */

}

// A Store entity with an embedded Address property
@Entity
public class Store {
  private Integer id;
  private Address address;

  public Store() {
  }

  @Id
  @SpaceId
  public Integer getId() {
    return this.id;
  }

  @Embedded
  @SpaceIndex(path = "city") // Address.city is indexed
  public Address getAddress() {
    return this.address;
  }

  /* Additional Getters &amp; Setters */

}
</code></pre>

<p>We created an Embeddable Address object and used it as a property in our Store object.</p>

<div class="tc-admon-tip">
  
  <p>Embeddable classes must be Serializable because they are transferred over the network.</p>
</div>

<p>It is possible to query a Store entity by an Address property in the following way:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
Query query = em.createQuery("SELECT store FROM com.gigaspaces.objects.Store store WHERE s.address.city = 'London'");
List&lt;Store&gt; result = (List&lt;Store&gt;) query.getResultList();
</code></pre>

<h1><a name="one-to-one"></a>One-to-One</h1>

<p>The JPA One-to-one relationship is very similar to an embedded relationship except for the fact that when querying
the owner entity it is possible to use an Inner Join.</p>

<p>As with Embeddable classes, owned entities in a relationship should always be Serializable since they are transferred over the network.</p>

<p>In the following example we show a One-to-one relationship between two entities, Order &amp; Invoice:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">@Entity
public class Order {
  private Long id;
  private Date date;
  private Invoice invoice;

  public Order() {
  }

  @Id
  @SpaceId
  public Long getId() {
    return this.id;
  }

  public Date getDate() {
    return this.date;
  }

  @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  @SpaceIndex(path = "sum", type = SpaceIndexType.ORDERED) // Invoice.sum is indexed
  public Invoice getInvoice() {
    return this.invoice;
  }

  // Additional Getters &amp; Setters...

}

// An Invoice entity which is owned in the relationship and
// therefore should implement Serializable
@Entity
public class Invoice implements Serializable {
  private Long id;
  private Double sum;

  public Invoice() {
  }

  @Id
  @SpaceId
  public Long getId() {
    return this.id;
  }

  public Double getSum() {
    return this.sum;
  }

  // Additional Getters &amp; Setters...

}
</code></pre>

<p>For one-to-one relationship we can use an Inner Join for querying:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
Query query = em.createQuery("SELECT order FROM com.gigaspaces.objects.Order order JOIN o.invoice invoice WHERE invoice.sum &gt; 499.99");
List&lt;Order&gt; orders = (List&lt;Order&gt;) query.getResultList();
</code></pre>

<div class="tc-admon-tip">
  
  <p>We defined an ordered index on Invoice.sum and therefore the above query takes advantage of the defined index.</p>
</div>

<h1><a name="one-to-many"></a>One-to-Many</h1>

<p>The JPA one-to-many relationship means that the owner of the relationship stores the owned entities in a collection within itself.</p>

<p>As with one-to-one, owned entities in a relationship should always be Serializable because they are transferred over the network.</p>

<p>Lets examine the following example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">// An Author entity which will be the owner of a relationship.
@Entity
public class Author {
  private Integer id;
  private String name;
  private List&lt;Book&gt; books;

  public Author() {
  }

  @Id @SpaceId
  public Integer getId() {
    return this.id;
  }

  @SpaceRouting // Routing is determined by the author's name
  public String getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  @SpaceIndex(path = "[*].id") // Books are indexed by their id
  public List&lt;Book&gt; getBooks() {
    return this.books;
  }

  // Additional Getters &amp; Setters..

}

// A Book entity which is owned in a relationship
// Book shouuld implement Serializable since its transferred over the network
@Entity
public class Book implements Serializable {
  private Integer id;
  private String name;

  public Book() {
  }

  @Id
  @SpaceId
  public Integer getId() {
  }

  public String getName() {
  }

  // Additional Getters &amp; Setters..

}
</code></pre>

<p>We can use a JPQL Inner Join for querying an Author by a specific Book id:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
Query query = em.createQuery("SELECT author FROM com.gigaspaces.objects.Author author JOIN author.books book WHERE book.id = 100");
Author result = (Author) query.getSingleResult();
</code></pre>

<div class="tc-admon-tip">
  
  <p>We defined an index on Book.id and therefore the above query takes advantage of the defined index.</p>
</div>

<h1><a name="limitations"></a>Limitations</h1>

<h3><a name="working-with-embedded-entities"></a>Working with Embedded Entities</h3>

<p>When working with embedded entities its not possible to call JPA methods on owned entities.</p>

<h3><a name="owned-many-to-many-relationship"></a>Owned Many-to-Many Relationship</h3>

<p>Owned many-to-many relationship is not supported because the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> data model doesn't permit it.
It is possible to implement such a relation by explicitly setting the IDs for each of the relationship participants.</p>

<h3><a name="unowned-relationships"></a>Unowned Relationships</h3>

<p>Unowned relationships where each part of the relation is represented as a Data Type in Space is not supported.</p>
