<h1>Policy Settings</h1>
  

<p>When you select a space node in the Cluster Tree, the information panel shows configuration details for that space, in the context of the attributes of its group. For example, if a space belongs to a replication and load balancing group, the information panel shows its replication and load balancing settings.</p>

<h1><a name="viewing-replication-settings">&#160;</a>Viewing Replication Settings</h1>

<p>To view the replication settings of a space, first select it by clicking its node in the tree or double-clicking it in the visual display area. In the information panel, click the <span class="tc-bold">Replication</span> tab, then the internal tab <span class="tc-bold">Settings</span>. The <span class="tc-bold">Replication</span> tab can be clicked only if the space belongs to a replication group.
For more information on these settings, see <a href="replication-group-gigaspaces-browser.html">Replication Options</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="viewing-load-balancing-settings">&#160;</a>Viewing Load-Balancing Settings</h1>

When an Entry is highlighted, the lower pane shows the name of the object selected (<span class="tc-italic">Name</span>), its field type (<span class="tc-bold">Type</span>) and whether or not it is indexed (<span class="tc-bold">true</span> or <span class="tc-bold">false</span>).</p>
