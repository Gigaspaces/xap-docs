        <h1><a name="custom-mirror-service-name"></a>Custom Mirror Service Name</h1>
        <p>A Mirror Service can be configured per Space cluster. You can't have multiple Mirror services configured for the same space cluster.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-tip">
            <p>If you need "multiple mirrors" for the same space cluster you can implement a Mirror Service that will route the data and operations to other multiple "agents" that will persist the data - effectively make the default Mirror act as a dispatcher.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If you have multiple different space clusters, each with its own Mirror service running, you should use a different name for each Mirror Service.</p>
        <p>The Mirror Service name is used as part of the space config, specified via the <code>cluster-config.mirror-service.url</code> property. Its default is <code>jini://*/mirror-service_container/mirror-service</code> which match the "mirror-service" that is used as part of the <code>url</code> property used to start the mirror service.</p>
        <p>As an example, let's say we would like to call my mirror service <code>mymirror-service</code> (instead of the default <code>mirror-service</code>). Here is how the mirror service should be started:</p><pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;ProcessingUnit&gt;
  &lt;Mirrors&gt;
    &lt;add Name="myMirror-service"&gt;
      &lt;SourceSpace Name="mySpace" Partitions="..." Backups="..."/&gt;
      &lt;ExternalDataSource Type="GigaSpaces.Practices.ExternalDataSource.NHibernate.NHibernateExternalDataSource"&gt;
        &lt;!-- NHibernate-specific config goes here --&gt;
      &lt;/ExternalDataSource&gt;
    &lt;/add&gt;
  &lt;/Mirrors&gt;
&lt;/ProcessingUnit&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>Here is how the space should be started:</p><pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;ProcessingUnit&gt;
  &lt;EmbeddedSpaces&gt;
    &lt;add Name="mySpace" Mirrored="true"&gt;
      &lt;ExternalDataSource Type="GigaSpaces.Practices.ExternalDataSource.NHibernate.NHibernateExternalDataSource" 
                          Usage="ReadOnly"&gt;
        &lt;!-- NHibernate-specific config goes here --&gt;
      &lt;/ExternalDataSource&gt;
      &lt;Properties&gt;
        &lt;add Name="cluster-config.mirror-service.url" Value="jini://*/mymirror-service_container/mymirror-service"/&gt;
      &lt;/Properties&gt;
    &lt;/add&gt;
  &lt;/EmbeddedSpaces&gt;
&lt;/ProcessingUnit&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>In some cases you may need to asynchronously persist data both into a relational database and a file, or persist the data into a relational database and transfer some of the data into some other system.</p>
        <p>In such a case you may need to have multiple mirrors. In order to implement this, you should have one base mirror (for example the Hibernate Space Persistency) and extend it to include the extra functionality you may need.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
