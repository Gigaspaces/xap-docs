        <h1>Timeout, Filters and Lease Manager</h1>
        <p>The <span class="tc-bold">General</span> tab contains settings related to client and server timeout, and the <span class="tc-bold">Lease Manager</span>.</p>

            <p>If your client application loses its connection to the server, you can follow a simple procedure to check whether the server erased any of your notify templates in the interim:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>For each notify template, write an Entry to the space that matches the template.</li>
                <li>Verify that you receive a notification.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If there is no notification, this means two things. First, while you were disconnected, new Entries matching the notify template entered the space. (You can try to find them; depending on their lease time, they may still exist.) Second, as a result, your notify template was erased.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The <span class="tc-bold">Space Filters</span> option specifies whether filters should be enabled or disabled for this Space. Filters are hooks inside the GigaSpaces engine that enable integration with external systems and/or implementation of user-defined logic inside the Space. The <code>DefaultSecurityFilter</code> is part of every Space by default, and it controls user permissions for the Space. Click <span class="tc-bold">Edit</span> to launch the Filter Management dialog, which allows you to add custom filters and to manage the behavior of the default and custom filters.</p>
