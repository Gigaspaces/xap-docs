        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">GigaOps Stack</h1>
        <p>Being data-driven is extremely crucial for any organization looking to enable continuous innovation, to avoid falling behind and to lower TCO. Much like DevOps in the enterprise, the emergence of enterprise DataOps mimics the practices of modern data management at large internet companies over the past 10 years.</p>
        <p>DataOps is about automatically managing all your data life cycle in a modern data management approach. It’s about how to provision the resource for your data, scale the database, tune the data for performance, and automate the data management or data team between different platforms or different stores.</p>
        <p>The GigaOps Stack reduces the complexity of all aspects required to implement <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> products via a self-service cluster with end-to-end provisioning, ability to deploy new services, auto-recovery, self-monitoring, and tracing.</p>

        <h1>Stack Components</h1>
        <p>The GigaOps Stack is comprised of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">gsctl</span> - a standalone CLI tool that you can use to create, provision, and install <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> clusters in the cloud, on premise, or in hybrid environments.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">Ops Manager</span> - the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> native administration tool, which is web based and runs automatically when <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> services are deployed. Use Ops Manager for monitoring, alerts, scaling, interactive queries, and deploying and upgrading your applications.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">Monitoring stack</span> - based on InfluxDB, Grafana, and Telegraf for monitoring <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> cluster activity and metrics using pre-defined dashboards and built-in alerts, plus Zipkin for distributed tracing.</li>
            <li><span class="tc-bold">ElasticGrid</span> or <span class="tc-bold">Kubernetes</span> enterprise-grade orchestration that automates deploying, scaling, and managing applications and services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The GigaOps Stack utilizes the DataOps approach, which takes DevOps best practices and applies them to managing data as a global asset in your organization. Using the GigaOps Stack provides auto-installation and provisioning of servers, networking, and security using gsctl, along with full orchestration and installing the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> platform.</p>
        <h4>Auto-Provisioning</h4>
        <p>With the GigaOps Stack, the installation and configuration process is completely automated. This saves time and resources, and prevents errors that might otherwise occur due to manual configuration of the environment.</p>
        <h4>Elastic Orchestration</h4>
        <p>The GigaOps Stack manages orchestration, scheduling, service life cycle, and resource prioritization across the environment. The stack makes global decisions about scheduling, and can detect and respond to cluster events. For example, identifying healthy and unhealthy nodes so that it can make decisions about where to place pods.</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Canary Deployment</h4>
        <p>The GigaOps Stack supports canary deployment, so you can apply <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> upgrades or custom application upgrades to a small subset of users before introducing the change on a widespread scale. </p>
        <div class="tc-align-center">

            </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Auto-Scaling</h4>
        <p>As the load on your system gets larger or smaller, you may want the size of your cluster to adjust accordingly, to reduce spending on cloud services when they aren't necessary, or to maintain performance during peak times. With GigaOps Stack, your cluster can scale up or down automatically to support the current load.</p>
        <h4>Rolling Upgrades</h4>
        <p>You can implement <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> product upgrades or your own applications across your cluster with zero downtime.</p>
        <h4>Self-Healing</h4>
        <p>Benefit from high availability and robustness with the GigaOps Stack's ability to self-repair if a cluster node becomes unavailable or starts to fail.</p>
        <h4>Proactive Monitoring</h4>
        <p>ElasticGrid comes with pre-defined Grafana dashboards for monitoring your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> cluster. You can use these dashboards in conjunction with canary deployment to monitor performance and other metrics for each version that is deployed, or to assess the impact of a configuration change by comparing the metrics before and after it is implemented.</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Distributed Tracing</h4>
        <p>ElasticGrid includes Zipkin, a distributed tracing system that gathers timing data to enable troubleshooting latency issues in the system. This enables more effective performance tuning.</p>

## Using Apache Zeppelin with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />

Apache Zeppelin is a multi-purpose web notebook that supports data ingestion and discovery, as well as data analytics, visualization, and collaboration.

Apache Zeppelin contains a built-in Apache Spark integration. This provides the following:

- Automatic SparkContext and SQLContext injection
- Runtime JAR dependency loading from the local file system or Maven repository
- Ability to view job progress and cancel jobs 

The Zeppelin notebook packaged with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> includes several <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" /> demo applications, along with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />-specific settings that can be configured in the Spark interpreter in order to establish the connection between Spark and the data grid. 

KubeGrid runs Apache Zeppelin in a dedicated Pod, to enable ???
