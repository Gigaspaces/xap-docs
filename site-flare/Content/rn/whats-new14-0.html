        <h1>What's New</h1>
        <p>This section describes product changes, along with new features and functionality for InsightEdge Platform and XAP release 14.0.</p>
        <h1><a name="kubernetes-integration">&#160;</a>Kubernetes Integration</h1>
        <p>The InsightEdge Platform and the XAP data grid both support the Kubernetes environment. Benefits include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to deploy GigaSpaces-based applications in whatever environment best suits the business needs of the enterprise.</li>
            <li>Kubernetes synergizes with InsightEdge and XAP, simplifying the operationalizing of machine learning and transactional processing at scale.</li>
            <li>InsightEdge and XAP utilize key features of Kubernetes, such as cloud-native orchestration automation with self-healing, cooperative multi-tenancy, and RBAC authorization.</li>
            <li>Auto-deployment of data services and deep learning and machine learning frameworks, such as Apache Spark, Stateful Sets (analogous to Processing Units), as well as the Apache Zeppelin web notebook.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="tc-iconinfo">&#160;</span> For more information, see <a href="../admin/orchestration.html">Orchestration</a>.</p>
        <h1><a name="tiered-storage-memoryxtend">&#160;</a>Tiered Storage (MemoryXtend)</h1>
        <p>This version of InsightEdge and XAP introduces our newest Persistent Memory (PMEM) driver for the MemoryXtend module. The combined strength of <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/re-architecting-data-center-memory-storage-hierarchy/">Optane DC Persistent Memory</a> and the InsightEdge Platform provides customers with the required performance and TCO optimization for uncompromised business results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In-memory extreme performance at at a significantly lower cost.</li>
            <li>Large reduction in the number of servers required, which reduces footprint, power, maintenance, network and other overhead costs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="tc-iconinfo">&#160;</span> For more information, see <a href="../admin/memoryxtend-pmem.html">MemoryXtend for PMEM</a>.</p>
        <h1><a name="hot-swap-rebalancing-with-zero-downtime">&#160;</a>Hot Swap - Rebalancing with Zero Downtime</h1>
        <p>Our new demote capability in the REST Manager API makes it easier, faster, and simpler to rebalance a system after significant environment change scenarios, such as  failover or scaling. In the past, the only way to demote a primary instance in order to rebalance a system was to force a restart. Now customers can write their own rebalancing policies that take advantage of the ability to perform a hot swap during runtime, without having to reload the data.</p>
        <p><span class="tc-iconinfo">&#160;</span> For more information, see <a href="../admin/resource-load-balancing.html">Hot Primary Swap</a>.</p>
        <h1><a name="enhanced-web-notebook-functionality">&#160;</a>Enhanced Web Notebook Functionality</h1>
        <p>InsightEdge now offers a JDBC-based interpreter for Apache Zeppelin. Customers can use this new interpreter to access data directly from the data grid, instead of via a Spark interpreter. This provides incredible value for analysts and developers, who can now visualize the Space data within the Zeppelin notebook.</p>
        <p><span class="tc-iconinfo">&#160;</span> For more information, see <a href="../started/insightedge-zeppelin.html">Using the InsightEdge Web Notebook</a>.</p>
