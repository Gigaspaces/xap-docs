<h1>The Processing Unit</h1>
  <p>The Processing Unit is the unit of packaging and deployment in the GigaSpaces XAP platform. This section describes its <a href="./the-processing-unit-structure-and-configuration.htm/">directory structure</a> and how to set the values in the <a href="./configuring-processing-unit-elements.htm/">configuration file</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="./obtaining-cluster-information.htm/">obtain cluster information</a> about the topology, member ID and other related parameters. Cluster information can be provided to the processing unit instances at deployment time. You can also <a href="./reloading-business-logic.htm/">reload business logic</a> (Spring beans) without shutting down the application or undeploying a Processing Unit.</p>

<p>If you want to build a <a href="./custom-processing-unit-details-and-monitors.htm/">Custom Processing Unit</a>, you can can implement the ServiceDetailsProvider and ServiceMonitorsProvider interfaces to expose information to calling APIs, or to be viewable in the Web Managment Console.</p>

<p>In order to <a href="./deploying-and-running-overview.htm/">deploy and run</a> the Processing Unit, you have to choose the appropriate runtime mode and possibly do some debugging. There are also a number of deployment properties that can be set.</p>
