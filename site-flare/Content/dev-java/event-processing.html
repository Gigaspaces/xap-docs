<h1>Event Processing</h1>
  

<p>This section describes the event processing APIs and how to configure them on top of the Space. The relevant APIs include the <a href="notify-container-overview.html">Notify Container</a>, which wraps the Space data event session API with event container abstraction, and the <a href="polling-container-overview.html">Polling Container</a>, which allows you to perform polling receive operations against the Space.</p>

<p>Events that are received by the polling and notify containers are handled by the <a href="data-event-listener.html">Event Listener</a>, which is a Space Data Event Listener and the <a href="event-exception-handler.html">Event Exception Listener</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding <a href="fifo-overview.html">FIFO Ordering</a>, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> supports both non-ordered Entries and FIFO ordered Entries when performing Space operations. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> also includes <a href="messaging-support.html">JMS message support</a> that is built on top of the core Space architecture.</p>
