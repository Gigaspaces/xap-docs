        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> Ops Manager</h1>
        <p> The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> Ops Manager is an enterprise-grade management platform that can be implemented for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />-based applications across on-premise, cloud, and Kubernetes environments. Ops&#160;Manager is a robust web interface that provides visibility and real-time information about your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> clusters and their services. It enables you to better monitor your clusters, and perform troubleshooting activities by analyzing various performance metrics, and reviewing alerts with defined thresholds. You can drill down to the partition level and create dump files, to review service log files for root-cause analysis.</p>
        <p>In addition to real-time monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities, Ops Manager enables you to review and analyze data that resides within the cluster. Use Ops Manager to review Space-related information, such as object types and properties, and execute various queries as part of data discovery.</p>
        <p>Using Ops Manager, you can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>View the status of services to identify healthy and unhealthy clusters.</li>
            <li>Review and monitor cluster performance in terms of CPU usage,&#160;latency, IOPS (such as reads and writes) and memory usage metrics.</li>
            <li>Drill down to specific services and review performance metrics and alerts at the level of a single service.</li>
            <li>Analyze alert trends and volume filtered by time, type, etc.</li>
            <li>Review individual service instances and analyze alerts per instance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Accessing Ops Manager</h1>
        <p>The Ops Manager is deployed along with the Manager and the REST&#160;Manager API, and uses the same entry point. In order to open Ops Manager in your browser and view your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> environment, you need to access the Manager's IP&#160;address on port 8090, or use <span class="tc-bold">localhost</span> if your environment is deployed on a local agent. </p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>If you had a previous version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" />,  when you used the Manager IP&#160;address and port in the URL field of your browser to access the REST&#160;Manager API (<span class="tc-italic">http://&lt;MANAGER_IP&gt;:8090/</span>), you were automatically redirected to <span class="tc-italic">http://&lt;MANAGER_IP&gt;:8090/v2</span>. This information may be stored in your browser cache and prevent you from opening Ops Manager. If this occurs, clear your browser cache to enable access to Ops Manager. If you want to open the REST&#160;Manager API, use the <span class="tc-italic">http://&lt;MANAGER_IP&gt;:8090/v2</span> URL.</p>

        <h2>Cluster Metrics</h2>
        <p>Ops Manager includes graphs that display the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CPU&#160;usage - view the average CPU utilization as a percentage. This metric is available at the cluster level, and at the service level.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.DoNotShow">Memory usage - view the actual RAM usage, along with secondary storage tier (off-heap ) usage.</li>
            <li>IOPS - View the implemented IOPS types (such as reads, writes, takes, executes, etc. per second at the cluster level, and at the service level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ops Manager metrics can be ported to InfluxDB or other time series databases, so that you can use external monitoring and visualization tools (such as Grafana) to perform additional analysis.</p>
        <h2>Service Overview</h2>
        <p>The service overview shows a summary of all services vs. unhealthy services. You can also view the services sorted by health and severity. Additionally, you can apply filters by service type and RAM&#160;utilization, or search for specific services by name. Click a service to drill through to see the individual performance metrics and alerts for that service. For deeper analysis, you can create a dump file of the service logs via the download button in the upper right-hand corner.</p>
        <p>In addition to reviewing the performance of individual services, you can drill down to the partition and instance level to review metrics such as CPU&#160;usage and memory consumption per specific instance.</p>
