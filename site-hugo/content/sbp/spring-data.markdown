XAP Spring Data implements the [Spring Data Framework](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data) that lets you use the concepts to the development of applications using XAP's In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) as the data store. XAP Spring Data supports high-level abstractions to simplify configuration and development.

This section is the reference guide for Spring Data with XAP. It explains basic and advanced configuration and usage of XAP IMDG features assuming the reader is already familiar with the [Spring Framework](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/1.9.1.RELEASE/reference/html/) and [XAP application development](http://docs.gigaspaces.com).
