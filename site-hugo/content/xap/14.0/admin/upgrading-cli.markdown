The 12.3 release has introduced a new [Command Line Interface](tools-cli.html), which provides a simpler syntax and is cloud-friendly (based on the [REST Manager API](admin-rest-manager-api.html)). 

The [legacy CLI](command-line-interface.html) is still supported, but starting v14.0 it is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Customers upgrading from older versions are encouraged to upgrade to the new CLI.

To get started with the new CLI, simply run `xap --help` from the product's `bin` folder.
