[Hibernate integration](./hibernate-space-persistency.html){{<wbr>}}
The default Hibernate implementation of the Space Persistency APIs.

[Space Data Source API](./space-data-source-api.html){{<wbr>}}
The space Data Source API is used for reading data and meta data from the data source.

[Space Synchronization Endpoint API](./space-synchronization-endpoint-api.html){{<wbr>}}
The space synchronization endpoint API is used for synchronizing data from the space to an external application or a data base.

[Initial Load](./space-persistency-initial-load.html){{<wbr>}}
Space data source initial Load pre-loads the space with data before it is available for clients.

[Asynchronous Persistence](./asynchronous-persistency-with-the-mirror.html){{<wbr>}}
Reliable Asynchronous Persistency (Mirror)

[Transient Entries](./transient-entries.html){{<wbr>}}
How to specify that some objects in a persistent space should not be saved to the persistent storage.

[Advanced Concepts](./space-persistency-advanced-topics.html){{<wbr>}}

[Migrating Hibernate](./persistency-migrating-hibernate.html){{<wbr>}}
XAP's persistency approach consists of several paradigms for data persistency, according to the application needs. This section gives a basic overview of each paradigm.

[Migrating External Data Source](./migrating-from-external-data-source-api.html){{<wbr>}}
This page describes how EDS implementations prior to XAP version 9.5 should migrate to the new Space Persistency APIs.
