        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Upgrading from a Previous Version</h1>
        <p>If you are currently using a previous version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> or <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />, contact <a href="mailto:support@gigaspaces.com">support@gigaspaces.com</a> for information on how to upgrade to the most recent <a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/download-center">version</a>.</p>
        <p>As a best practice, when upgrading to the latest version, unzip the downloaded software package and port the necessary changes from your previous environment into your new environment. It is recommended to use the new distribution as-is.</p>
        <h1><a name="backwards-compatibility"></a>Backwards Compatibility</h1>
        <p>This version of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIEP" /> is backwards compatible to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> version 12.x (most APIs and client-server). But a change operation from older version client is NOT supported. For more information about GigaSpaces' backwards compatibility policy, refer to the <MadCap:xref href="lifecycle.html">Product Life Cycle and End-of-Life Policy</MadCap:xref> page.</p>
        <p>For information about product changes that may affect your upgrade process, refer to the sections on Upgrading from a Previous Version for the following releases: <a href="/xap/12.3/rn/upgrading.html">12.3</a>, <a href="/xap/12.2/rn/upgrading.html">12.2</a>, <a href="/release_notes/121upgrading.html">12.1</a>, and <a href="/release_notes/120upgrading.html">12.0</a>.</p>
        <h1 MadCap:conditions="Version.15-0-born">Default GSC Service Limit</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Version.15-0-born">The default GSC service limit has been changed to 1. If this causes problems in your system, you can change this value via either the GS_GSC_SERVICE_LIMIT environment variable, or the <code>com.gigaspaces.grid.gsc.serviceLimit</code> system property.</p>
        <h1 MadCap:conditions="Version.14-5-born">GigaSpaces Command Line Interface (CLI)</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Version.14-5-born">The scripts that run the command line interface (new and legacy) have been unified, and are now in a single script called "gs". This script starts the latest CLI by default (version 2). For more information, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../admin/upgrading-cli.html">Upgrading the CLI</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h1 MadCap:conditions="Version.14-5-born">Maven Integration</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Version.14-5-born">Up to and including release 14.2, a dedicated script was used to install <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> Maven artifacts to a local Maven repository (installmavenrep), along with an additional script for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameIE" />. These scripts have been removed as of release 14.5, and the functionality is now provided by the new <code>gs install maven</code> command in the CLI. For more information, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../started/installation-maven-overview.html">Maven Artifacts</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h1 MadCap:conditions="Version.14-2-born,Version.14-5-died">Changes to <MadCap:variable name="General.XAPNet" />&#160;Package</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Version.14-2-born,Version.14-5-died">Due to <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Version.14-5-died">recent </MadCap:conditionalText>changes in the available Java distributions, Java is no longer packaged with <MadCap:variable name="General.XAPNet" />. By default, if you have Java already installed on the host machine then XAP.NET will use it (via the JAVA_HOME environment variable). For more information, see the <MadCap:xref href="../dev-dotnet/jvm-configuration.html">JVM Configuration</MadCap:xref> topic of the <MadCap:variable name="General.XAPNet" /> section.</p>
