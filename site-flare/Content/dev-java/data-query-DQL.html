        <h2>Tips for Writing a Data Query using <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> API</h2>
        <p>The purpose of these tips is to enable fetching from each partition a minimal number of objects and filtering out what we can at the partition level.</p>
        <p>If one of twp table being joined is very small, instead of distributing it between partitions, we can have a copy of it in each partition enabling us to cut the data that is brought in from the larger table.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Have an understanding of the service will be asking the query against and determine if more conditions should be added per table.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preparing an execution plan takes time. By using a prepared statement instead of hard-coded parameters we can resuse the same plan as it is kept in the cache.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use Explain Analyze for debugging/troubleshooting  to understand the execution flow and expected time-line. This will also help to improve your query.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure each table's conditions are included in the select query that goes with it. This way, each table will have its conditions stated clearly, helping to get only the necessary records.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Avoid a full scan of tables by adding indexes which allow faster access. Choose indexes per each table according to condition.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When conditions are related to 2 tables as t1.f1 &gt; t2.f3 add the condition to the join: ON ti.f1=t2.f2 and t1.f1 &gt; t2.f3</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Consider using broadcast tables for small tables. Also, use colocated filters and collocated joins where suitable. To allow colocated joins with small tables, link to the broadcast table subject. A colocated join will copy the smaller table in join to all partitions - consider if the small table of the join is indeed small. In the future, routing properties will also be used to optimize joins.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Imagine you have large amount of data that is split into several smaller amounts, called partitions. Now, let's say you want to combine information from two different tables, but both of these tables are also big and split into partitions.</p>
                <p>Normally, when you're combining data from two tables, you can filter out the records you don't need based on certain conditions. But if these tables are both split into partitions and spread out, it becomes tricky. You can't directly filter out records from each partition based on the conditions you want to apply for the join. Instead, you have to bring all the data from these partitions to your client and then do the filtering there. It's like gathering all the puzzle pieces onto your table before you can start putting the puzzle together.</p>
