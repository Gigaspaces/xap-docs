        <h1>Asynchronous Persistency - Write Behind</h1>
        <p>The XAP Mirror Service provides reliable asynchronous persistency. This allows you to asynchronously delegate the operations conducted with the In-Memory-Data-Grid (IMDG) into a backend database, significantly reducing the performance overhead.</p>
        <div class="tc-align-center">
            <p>
                <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/data-grid-async-persist.jpg" alt="data-grid-async-persist.jpg" class="tc-picture80" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>The Mirror service ensures that data will not be lost in the event of a failure. This way, you can add persistency to your application just by running the Mirror Service, without touching the real-time portion of your application in either configuration or code. This service provides fine-grained control of which object needs to be persisted.</p>
        <p>The mirror does need a backup since it does not hold any state. The actual state of the latest committed database transaction stored within the primary and the backup space instances, <span class="tc-bold">not in the Mirror</span>. Essentially, the Mirror acts as a dispatcher and push the changes done at the space (all primary partitions) into the Database (or any other data source) in an asynchronous reliable manner. In case of a failure of the Mirror, it will be restarted automatically and the primary instances will playback the un-committed transactions while the Mirror was down. The Mirror PU (like any deployed service) is mobile. It can run on any machine running a GSC, so the GSM will pick one of the existing GSCs to provision the missing Mirror PU.</p>
        <p>If from some reason the SLA you applied forcing the Mirror PU to run on a specific machine that is unavailable (for example on a specific zone which does not have any running containers), the primary and backup will hold the transaction data within their redo log queue in memory. In some point they will store it on file until the Mirror machine will be restarted.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-tip">
            <p>You should not deploy the mirror in clustered mode nor have multiple instances of it. It should have a single instance as part of its SLA configuration.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Enabling the Mirror Service involves the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Data-Grid Processing Unit Mirror Settings</li>
            <li>The Mirror Service Processing Unit Settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above share the <span class="tc-bold">same</span> <a href="space-persistency-overview.html">Space Persistency</a> settings but have different space settings. See the <a href="hibernate-space-persistency.html">NHibernate Space Persistency</a> for details how to use the built-in <code>HibernateExternalDataSource</code>.</p>
        <h1><a name="the-data-grid-processing-unit">&#160;</a>The Data Grid Processing Unit</h1>
        <p>The <code>cluster-config.mirror-service</code> <code>space</code> settings specify the interaction between the IMDG primary spaces and the Mirror Service. The <code>mirror="true"</code> <code>space</code> element tag enables the replication mechanism from the IMDG Primary spaces to the Mirror Service. Once the <code>mirror="true"</code> is specified, all IMDG members will be Mirror aware and will be delegating their activities into the Mirror service. The IMDG primary instance will replicate the operations that have been logged within the primary redo log every <code>interval-millis</code> amount of time or <code>interval-opers</code> amount of operations. Both of these mechanisms are always active and the first one that is breached triggers the replication event.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-tip">
            <p>If you are not using the <code>mirror="true"</code> with the Data-Grid PU, you should use the following property instead:
<code>cluster-config.mirror-service.enabled=true</code></p>

        <h1><a name="optimizing-the-mirror-activity">&#160;</a>Optimizing the Mirror Activity</h1>
        <div class="tc-admon-important">
            <p>The database update rate by the Mirror is a function of the number of IMDG partitions, database update speed with a single thread, database transaction size, network latency between the Mirror and the Database, hibernate overhead (if hibernate is being used as the persistence mechanism), relevant table indexed columns, and the database record size. Also, when distributed transactions are used with the IMDG, this may improve the database update rate (since multiple partitions will be sending their updates to the Mirror, which can batch all cumulative updates to the database), but this will impact the IMDG transaction latency.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You might want to tune the IMDG and the Mirror activity to push data into the database faster. Here are some recommendations you should consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimize the Space Class structure to include fewer fields. Less fields means less overhead when the IMDG replicates the data to the Mirror Service.</li>
            <li>Tune the <code>bulk-size</code>, <code>interval-millis</code> and <code>interval-opers</code> to perform the replication in larger batches and less frequently. This means you should increase the <code>bulk-size</code>, <code>interval-millis</code> and <code>interval-opers</code> to have larger values than the defaults. The exact values depends with the network speed, the average size of the objects and the database configuration and machine speed. Here is an example for a configuration that is relevant for IMDG with relatively small objects (less than one K) and high rate of operations (more than 10,000 operations per second for partition):</li>
        </ul><pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;add Name="cluster-config.mirror-service.bulk-size" Value="10000"/&gt;
&lt;add Name="cluster-config.mirror-service.interval-millis" Value="5000"/&gt;
&lt;add Name="cluster-config.mirror-service.interval-opers" Value="50000"/&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>With the above configuration the primary partition will replicate its redo log activities to the Mirror service every 5 seconds or every 50,000 operations. The replication will occur in batches of 10,000 objects per batch.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tune the data source to commit data into the database in batches.</li>
            <li>Optimize the database transaction support.</li>
            <li>Implement a Mirror Service that will write the incoming data into a CSV file. This should be faster than writing data into the database. Later import the data into the database. (normally very fast operation)</li>
            <li>Increase the database maximum connections.</li>
            <li>Optimize Hibernate mapping and configuration. Using a proper <a href="space-persistency-advanced-topics.html#hibernate-id-generation">Hibernate ID generator</a> is crucial for getting optimum performance.</li>
            <li>Use PARTIAL_UPDATE (see <a href="the-space-operations.html">Partial Update</a>). Updates to an object that are performed using the PARTIAL_UPDATE modifier can be executed on the mirror as partial update as well. This can increase the performance in case a lot of updates are performed on a large object.
To use this optimization you need to set the following space property:</li>
        </ul><pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;add Name="cluster-config.mirror-service.supports-partial-update" Value="true"/&gt;
</code></pre>
