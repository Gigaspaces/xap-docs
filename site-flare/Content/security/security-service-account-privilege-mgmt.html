        <h1 class="tc-pagetitle">Service Account Privilege Management</h1>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> already secures <b>user accounts</b> by, for example, <a href="../spacedeck/spacedeck-admin.html">using IDP</a>. This is now being expanded to include the securing of <b>service accounts</b>. A Service Account &#160;is an account that is typically used by an application or a compute workload. It is an application that wishes to access <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> resources. This could either be a user of applications or components that wish to access <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> APIs. A service account differs to a user account in that it is associated with software that runs in our <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> or Smart DIH environments. </p>
        <p>The service account has both internal and external applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Internal Smart DIH</b>: A user performs an action, but something needs to happen from that trigger. Each action has their own life cycle and is disconnected from the user who has initialized it all. An example of internal use is  data pipeline or data micro-services. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>External Applications</b>: An application which wants to read from our <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> or Smart DIH environments. For example, a user who wishes to write a Java application to read from them. The application does not necessarily need to be deployed on the same Kubernetes cluster. A service account needs to be defined for each applications before they can access <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> API. &#160;These applications will all require authentication and authorization capabilities. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>An external IDP cannot be relied upon as it cannot manage services, only users.</p>
        </div>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> has a mechanism that will manage the service account application types mentioned above.</p>
        <h1>Authentication Flow</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Security/Copy of ServiceAccount_AuthFlow4.drawio.png" style="width: 1009px;height: 599px;" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>An application is introduced that wants to access the Space, like a PU. By default the Space is locked for read/write access.</p>
                <p>The application contains a secret (hidden) secret.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As part of the connection process, the application asks the authentication service (part of Kubernetes) if it accepts the secret and then tries to match that secret with an existing secret that it already has stored.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a match is found the secret is accepted. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If no match is found, the access to the Space is denied.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A JWT token is created. The JWT&#160;token is used to check for validity and is authenticated. It is temporary and contains an expiration date.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The JWT token is used to authenticate and authorize access to the Space. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Space checks the JWT token and the roles (for example read/write permission associated to the role). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the JWT or the role in the JWT are not permitted, the Space will deny access.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the access is granted, then access to the Space will be granted.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Internal Smart DIH</b>: Services that are created  from within our <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> or Smart DIH environments, such as a Pipeline or a Micro-Service, will automatically be registered. &#160;A service account will be created for any new service and this will be transparent to the user.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>External Applications</b>: There is an interface through which a user can register their application as a service account so <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> is aware of it.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the services are defined,  roles can be assigned to them.  From then, all the privileges management uses the RBAC model which replicates what is implemented for user accounts. Due to this, it seamlessly compliments the already available security authorization management.</p>

        <h1 style="background-color: #ffffff;">Service Account Secrets</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #ffffff;">Service account secrets are generated by <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> automatically. &#160;Users cannot generate or provide their own secrets. &#160;SpaceDeck is used to manage the secrets of the Service Accounts. They are certain default Service Accounts that will always be displayed and they are required to run the system. These are predefined in the system.</p>
        <h1 style="background-color: #ffffff;">Authorization</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #ffffff;">Through&#160;SpaceDeck <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">(see TBD)</span>, roles can be defined per service accounts. This uses the same mechanism that is employed for user accounts. &#160;The Space doesn't differentiate between a user or an application, it just checks the JWT token and authenticates it against the application which has created it. The Space checks the authenticity of the JWT token and receives the claim + role. In terms of authorization, the role is being checked according to the role and privileges contained in it and knows if the requested operations are allowed or not.</p>
        <h1 style="background-color: #ffffff;">Best Practice</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p style="background-color: #ffffff;">It is advised to change the secret if there is a problem with the application or if you think it has been compromised. In this case, the service account can also be revoked, which blocks it<span style="background-color: #ffff00;"> (see SpaceDeck...)</span>. The secret is not typically changed for internal processes (e.g. Pipeline) unless it is suspected that someone is compromising the secret, as this would block everything (e.g. the XAP&#160;Manager for performing scale operations, or the creation of Pipelines).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="background-color: #ffffff;">It is important to note that the expiration of the JWT token is not the same as the expiration of the secret. The JWT token can have an expiration time configured for 5 minutes, for example, and this means it can be used even if that service account is revoked. Only after the expiry time, after being revoked (in this example 5 minutes), and  a  new JWT&#160;token is requested will the application not be provided with one. In summary, the post revoke access is not blocked until the JWT token has expired.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="background-color: #ffffff;">Secrets should be rotated. <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> currently does not have the ability for automatic rotations. &#160;This means, users should rotate the secrets manually through SpaceDeck, every half a year with the procedure provided by <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />. &#160;When the secrets in the authentication server are rotated this will necessitate changing all the secrets in the external clients.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 style="background-color: #ffffff;">How To</h1>
        <p>Please refer to our SpaceDeck documentation <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">(TBD)</span> which explains how service accounts,. secrets, roles and privileges are created and managed.</p>
        <p>Operations: Create, Revoke, Unrevoke, Delete</p>
        <p>Cannot use the same Service Name more than once.</p>
