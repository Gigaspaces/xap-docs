            <p>The IIDR Db2 z/OS agent can be installed on a remote Linux machine without a need to install any IIDR software on the z/OS machine itself. </p>
            <p>However, there is a need to create users on a z/OS machine itself in order to ensure a transparent connectivity of the IIDR z/OS agent to the Db2 on z/OS.</p>
            <p>The recommended approach is to create two different users on a z/OS side with each having a different set of privileges, as outlined in the table below:</p>

            <p>IIDR will remotely install and execute an external stored procedure. The stored procedure will run in a Workload Manager (WLM) environment. </p>
            <p>The WLM environment must be dedicated to a single instance of IIDR to avoid interactions with other applications. </p>
            <p>The WLM environment can be created by following the Db2 documentation. Please provide the name of the WLM environment.</p>
            <p>OMVS access and segment need to be granted to user GSLO and create a home directory.</p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a new WLM environment  (POM.M.12)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Define the RACF resource DB2.CDBG.gscdcenv   uacc(READ) class(server)</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create the JCL procedure in the relevant PROCLIB</p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-bash">@ USER.Z24C.PROCLIB(GSCDC1)

            </ol>
            <h2>APF Authorized Libraries Prerequisites</h2>
            <p>The WLM address space must be APF-authorized. The JCL for the WLM address space must have an APF-authorized load library in its STEPLIB concatenation and the library must be created prior to configuring the product. Also, the user ID under which the WLM address space runs must be granted EXECUTE permission to that load library.</p>
            <p>For ease of use, provide the fully-qualified name of the APF-authorized load library to the IIDR administrator (GSHI). The product will automatically update the stored procedure’s load module in that library and refresh the WLM environment as needed. No administrative steps are needed on z/OS or Db2 with new maintenance - the updated stored procedure will be in effect immediately. The user credentials are stored on disk and must be protected from unauthorized access since writing to an APF-authorized library is a powerful capability.</p>
            <p>For added security, provide the fully-qualified name of a staging library to the IIDR administrator. The product will update the stored procedure's load module in that library but will fail to start. The IIDR administrator will need your help to copy CHCRLRSP from the staging library to the APF-authorized library associated with the WLM environment. The IIDR administrator will be able to start the product after the copy is complete. This manual copy step will be required every time the IDR administrator applies a patch to IDR.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>APF authorized libraries dynamically or permanently (in PROGxx)</p><pre xml:space="preserve"><code class="language-bash">/setprog apf,add,dsname=G00.IIDR.LOAD,volume=GWK001<br />/setprog apf,add,dsname=G00.IIDR.LOAD,SMS</code>
