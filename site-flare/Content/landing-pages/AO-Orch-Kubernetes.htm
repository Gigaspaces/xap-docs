        <h1>Kubernetes</h1>
        <p>Our Smart DIH uses Kuberenetes as its orchestration solution and as an enabler for using advanced technologies such as memory grid, streaming and automation. Using Kubernetes, Smart DIH provides high quality in the areas of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Network and compute control</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>High availability and self-healing</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Security</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>TCO reduction and maintainability</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Smart DIH installation using Helm charts ensures that the deployment of our solution is easier for operational staff to manage it. This is also due to the fact that best practices and standard Kubernetes procedures are followed. The installation is highly flexible and can be tailored to user needs by via a rich set of deployment parameters.</p>
