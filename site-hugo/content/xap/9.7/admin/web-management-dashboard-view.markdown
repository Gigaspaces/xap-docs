Once you've passed the login screen, you will enter the main dashboard screen. The dashboard gives you a single click view of the entire cluster, including alerts on various problematic conditions. Please refer the image below and the call-outs in it for more details:

# Alerts panel

The Alerts panel displays XAP Alert groups (Alerts are grouped by correlation key) for more details see [Administrative Alerts]({{%currentjavaurl%}}/administrative-alerts.html)

### Alerts dump

A logs dump can be retrieved for the alert's related grid components.
This can be done by opening the Alert Actions menu and clicking "Generate dump...", after which, a window will appear providing configuration of the dump:

Select the desired components for the dump and click "Generate", and a zip file will be downloaded containing log files for each of the selected components.

# Events time-line panel

At the bottom panel of the web dashboard, the events time line is displayed upon selection of the "Events" tab.
The events time-line shows the deployment life cycle of all the processing units.
To filter by application, the events time line is also available in the Application tab. (see [Application View](./web-management-application-view.html#Events time-line (per application)))

#### Life-cycle success events for each instance:

- installation attempt : an attempt to provision a processing unit instance on an available GSC
- instance added: a processing unit instance has successfully been instantiated on a GSC
- instance uninstalled: a processing unit instance has been successfully removed
- Container N/A: a processing unit instance is pending instantiation until an available GSC is discovered

#### Life-cycle success events for processing unit:

- installation succeeded: deployment of processing unit has been completed successfully (all instances instantiated)
- installation uninstalled: undeployment of processing unit has been completed (all instances undeployed)

#### Life-cycle failure events for each instance:

- installation failed: processing unit instance has failed to instantiate
- installation unresponsive: processing unit instance is unresponsive to "member-is-alive" attempts (suspecting failure)
- installation crashed: processing unit instance unresponsiveness has timed-out (detected failure)
- installation re-detected: processing unit instance was previously unresponsive but is now responsive.
