[Running in standalone mode](./running-in-standalone-mode.html){{<wbr>}}
Explains how to run your processing unit in standalone mode, which means that the processing unit is run under its own self-constructed classloader, based on the processing unit's directory structure.

[Deploying onto the service grid](./deploying-onto-the-service-grid.html){{<wbr>}}
Explains how to deploy your processing unit onto the GigaSpaces Service Grid to get automated SLA management and self-healing capabilities.

[Runtime properties](./deployment-properties.html){{<wbr>}}
The processing unit can be injected with dynamic property values at deployment time. The mechanism leverages Spring's PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer to provide powerful and simple properties-based injection.
