            <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
            <h2>System Requirements</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b>OpenShift Cluster</b>: Ensure this is properly installed. Refer to  <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/installing/installing_ibm_power/installing-ibm-power.html">Installing OS on IBM Power</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>OS</b>: Verify that the operating system installed is compatible with the OpenShift requirements (e.g. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Network</b>: Configure the network, storage and any other integration that meets the requirements of this guide. Plan for additional components, other than Smart DIH, and future growth of the system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>OpenShift Compatibility</b>: Make sure your Smart DIH installation matches the supported OpenShift versions for compatibility (currently this is OpenShift 14.4). This needs to be verified with the provider.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Smart DIH&#160;System Requirements</h2>
            <p>Installing Smart DIH requires specific specs. For a detailed sizing plan, reach out to <a href="mailto:support@gigaspaces.com">GigaSpaces support</a>. Below are general guidelines for CPU, RAM and disk capacity:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b>CPU</b>: Minimum of 4 cores per node.  More cores are recommended for heavy workloads.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>RAM:</b> At least 8GB per node.  This should be adjusted based on workload and data size.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Disk Space:</b> SSD storage is recommended for better performance.  Sufficient disk space should be allocated for data storage and commit logs.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Network Requirements</h2>
            <p>It is important to pay attention to the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Isolate Smart DIH from other components on the same cluster using firewall rules and gateways.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Configure ingress/routes to serve Smart DIH integration within the enterprise. For additional information refer to <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/networking/routes/route-configuration.html">OpenShift route configuration</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Set up a VPN to control traffic into the cluster based on your architecture and requirements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>	Ensure a 'zero-trust' configuration by enforcing all security measures.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
