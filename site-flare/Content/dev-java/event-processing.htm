<h1>Event Processing</h1>
  

<p>This section describes the event processing APIs and how to configure them on top of the Space. The relevant APIs include the <a href="./notify-container-overview.htm/">Notify Container</a>, which wraps the Space data event session API with event container abstraction, and the <a href="./polling-container-overview.htm/">Polling Container</a>, which allows you to perform polling receive operations against the Space.</p>

<p>Events that are received by the polling and notify containers are handled by the <a href="./data-event-listener.htm/">Event Listener</a>, which is a Space Data Event Listener and the <a href="./event-exception-handler.htm/">Event Exception Listener</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding <a href="./fifo-overview.htm/">FIFO Ordering</a>, XAP supports both non-ordered Entries and FIFO ordered Entries when performing Space operations. XAP also includes <a href="./messaging-support.htm/">JMS message support</a> that is built on top of the core Space architecture.</p>
