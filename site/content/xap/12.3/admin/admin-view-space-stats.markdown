You can use any of the administration tools to view operations statistics for a Space. If you have a system with MemoryXtend, you can access cache and blobstore metrics via the Admin API, and you can view these statistics in the Web Management Console and GigaSpaces Management Center.

{{%tab "Web Management Console"%}}

In the Web Management Console, you can view general operation statistics for a Space. If you have a system with MemoryXtend, you can also view cache and blobstore statistics.

**To view operation statistics:**

1. In the Spaces view, highlight the Space or the Space instance you want to investigate.
1. Click **Statistics** in the upper row of options, and then click **Operations** to display the operation statistics pane in the lower area of the view. 
1. The throughput statistics timeline only shows information that is collected in real time. Click **Stop** to stop it, and **Start** to start it running again.
1. To see the exact value of a specific operation for a specific point in time, hover the mouse over the graph for that time. The information is displayed in a tooltip.
1. The Operations Count graph displays a rough estimate of the number of various operations to the Space (or Space instance). To see the exact number of a particular operation, hover the mouse over the relevant graph bar. The exact number of operations is shown in a tooltip.

 {{% note "Note"%}}
 The operation statistics function doesnâ€™t save past events. If you stop the timeline for a length of time, you will lose the statistics that might have been gathered during that time. When you start the timeline again, it jumps to the current time.
 {{% /note %}}
 
 **To view MemoryXtend statistics:**
 
1. In the Spaces view, double-click the MemoryXtend Space instance for which you want to view statistics. This will drill through to the page that provides access to the Space instance details.
1. Click **Statistics** in the upper row of options, and then click **MemoryXtend** to display the MemoryXtend statistics for the Space instance.

The following statistics are displayed for off-heap storage:
