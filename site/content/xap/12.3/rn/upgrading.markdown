If you are currently using a previous version of XAP or InsightEdge, contact <support@gigaspaces.com> for information on how to upgrade to the most recent [version](https://www.gigaspaces.com/download-center).
 
# Backwards Compatibility

As a best practice, when upgrading to the latest version, unzip the downloaded software package and port the necessary changes from your previous environment into your new environment. It is recommended to use the new distribution as-is. 

This version of the InsightEdge Platform is backwards compatible to XAP version 11.0 (APIs and client-server). For more information, refer to the [Product Life Cycle and End-of-Life policy](http://www.gigaspaces.com/EOL) page.
