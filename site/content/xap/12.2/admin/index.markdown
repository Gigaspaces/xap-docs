[GigaSpaces Management Center](./gigaspaces-management-center.html){{<wbr>}}
GigaSpaces Management Center is a GUI that allows you to view spaces, containers, and clusters (and configure them), using the Space Browser tab. You can also deploy and manage services using the Deployments tab.

[Web Management Console](./web-management-console.html){{<wbr>}}
The web management console is a user interface where users can deploy, manage and monitor their Processing Units and Applications.

[REST Manager API](./xap-manager-rest.html)<br>
The XAP Manager provides a RESTful API for managing XAP environments.

[Data Grid Clustering](./data-grid-clustering.html){{<wbr>}}
Describes how in memory data grid clustering works. It also provides details of the failover, load-balancing, and replication facilities used.

[Service Level Agreement (SLA)](./the-sla-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
The XAP runtime environment (Service Grid) provides Service Level Agreement driven capabilities.

[Memory Management](./memory-management-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
Explains the different Space cache policies, memory usage, and rules for exceeding physical memory capacity.

[MemoryXtend](./memoryxtend-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
This storage interface allows Blob/Block/external type storage to act as a natural memory space for the in memory data grid.

[Logging](./logging-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
Explains how to configure logging with XAP. This includes formatting the log output, and selecting file names and rollover policies.

[Administration Tools](./administration-tools.html){{<wbr>}}
Explains the command line interface that is used to deploy, manage and monitor Processing Units and Applications.

[The Service Grid](./runtime-configuration.html){{<wbr>}}
Lists and explains the different runtime configuration parameters.

[Network Configuration](./network.html){{<wbr>}}
Explains how to configure the network in order for XAP to work properly.

[Monitoring](./monitoring.html){{<wbr>}}
Describes how to monitor XAP and your deployed application.

[Metrics](./metrics-overview.html){{<wbr>}}
Describes the core metrics concepts, and how to configure metrics collection.

[Performance Tuning](./tuning.html) {{<wbr>}}
Explains how to tune your XAP application. Covers topics like JVM tuning, thread usage and benchmarking.

[Benchmarking](./benchmarking.html){{<wbr>}}
Performance benchmarks with XAP's in memory data grid mainly involve testing latency and throughput.

[Quiesce Mode](./quiescemode.html){{<wbr>}}
Processing Units can be put into maintenance mode. When a Processing Unit is in maintenance mode, it rejects all data-related operations with an exception. This is useful when performing a safe shutdown or for a rolling system upgrade.

[Security](../security/index.html){{<wbr>}}
Explains GigaSpaces XAP security, where it fits in the GigaSpaces architecture, which components can be secured, and how to configure and customize the security depending on your application security requirements.

[XAP as a Windows Service](./installation-windows-service.html){{<wbr>}}
When using a Windows-based operating system for running GigaSpaces infrastructure, users may want to convert the Grid Service Agent into a Windows service.

[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.html){{<wbr>}}
Provides useful information on how to troubleshoot your XAP application.
