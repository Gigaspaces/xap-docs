            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> runs server side processing, providing the high performance of advanced operations and avoiding data retrieval back to the client side. Aggregation is performed in-memory, on relevant data only, regardless of total data size. It uses <a href="../overview/space-based-architecture.html">Space-Based Architecture</a> (SBA) as a primary design pattern. With SBA, applications are built out of a set of self-sufficient units, known as <a href="../dev-java/the-processing-unit-overview.html">Processing Units</a> (PU). These units are completely independent of each other, so that an application can scale without increasing complexity, just by adding more units. SBA is based on the Tuple Space paradigm. SBA follows many of the principles of Service-Oriented Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture, as well as elements of grid computing.</p>

                <h2>Transaction Processing</h2>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> provides a powerful solution for launching and running digital services. Its APIs support ultra-fast transaction processing and task execution that is event driven, offering high availability, reliability and scale. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" />’s server side processing accelerates performance and reduces networking and serialization overhead, even during peaks with high numbers of concurrent users. The platform supports both Kubernetes and alternative elastic orchestration systems.</p>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> offers efficient and cost-effective data replication across regions and clouds, and between cloud and on-premises deployments. It supports both polling and push notifications, including <a href="../dev-java/fifo-overview.html">FIFO</a> and <a href="../dev-java/fifo-grouping.html">FIFO grouping</a> ordering. Business rules can also be applied locally and remotely as they are embedded in each <a href="../admin/data-partitioning.html">partition</a> and on remote nodes.</p>
                <h2>Data Tiering</h2>
                <p>Data is stored in multiple data storage <a href="../dev-java/intelligent-tiering-intro.html">tiers</a> — hot (in-memory), and warm (SSD). User-defined business rules place the most important data (not necessarily the most frequently accessed data) in hot storage, while other data can be in warm storage. GigaSpaces manages the full data lifecycle by automatically storing the relevant data in the relevant tiers, federating the queries under the hood to gather all the data in optimal latency and evicting the data according to various policies, from least-recently-used (LRU) to user custom policies. </p>

                <h2>High Availability</h2>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> is an always-on, ACID-compliant and secured system, with disaster recovery ensured  through efficient data replication (Active-Passive) between sites, including hybrid environments.</p>

                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p><a href="../admin/data-grid-clustering.html">High availability</a> is achieved through the following levels with primary and backup instances:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Partition Level:</b> Highly-available partitions with synchronic <a href="../admin/replication.html">data replication</a> between primary  and backup instances for in-memory high availability.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Cluster Level</b>: Tier storage and disk persistence, together with built-in mirroring service to an  external database or disk, including initial load and store to database, delivering disk persistence to any storage class or database.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Site Level</b>: Efficient asynchronous data replication (active-passive or active-active) between  sites or regions, including hybrid environment for conflict resolution and disaster recovery.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Multi-Region Replication</h2>
                <p><a href="../dev-java/multi-site-replication-overview.html">Multi-Region Replication</a> is implemented for disaster recovery planning, where each site is distant from the other sites, even on a different continent; for <a href="../production/production-failover-considerations.html">failover</a> scenarios when one site acts as a failover target for another, or to maintain data locality for performance or regulations. For more information, see Multi-Region Replication.</p>
                <h2>Distributed WAN Gateway</h2>
                <p>The <a href="../solution-hub/wan-gateway-distributed.html">distributed WAN Gateway</a> enables bidirectional replication of data between cloud repositories or to and from cloud storage. This distributed WAN Gateway is totally stateless, ensuring no loss of data. Transactions at the local site are replicated in atomic manner in the correct order to the remote sites. Site bootstrapping ensures that once a site starts, it can reload its entire data or specific data from a remote site without introducing data consistency problems.</p>
                <p>The WAN Gateway replication utilizes a custom plugin that allows users to filter or modify data before it is replicated, and also after it has been replicated at each source or target node. In addition, the WAN replication topology can be updated in runtime - adding or removing remote sites does not result in system shutdown.</p>
                <h2>Persistence</h2>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> <a href="../started/xap-tutorial-part7.html">data persistence</a> consists of two components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Space Data Source</b>: Handles the pre-loading of data and the lazy load of data from from the persistence layer</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Space Synchronization Endpoint</b>: Handles changes made within the space delegation to the  persistence layer</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This Space persistence provides classes which can be extended and then used to load and store data  in an existing data source. Data is loaded from the data source during space initialization, after which the application works with the space directly.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/qsg/data-grid-sync-persistNew.jpg" alt="image" class="tc-picture80" />

                <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> Persistency Components</p>
                <h2>Mirror Service</h2>
                <p>The GigaSpaces <a href="../dev-java/asynchronous-persistency-with-the-mirror.html">mirror service</a> (write behind) provides reliable asynchronous persistence. This allows for the asynchronous delegation of the operations conducted with the In-Memory-Data-Grid (IMDG) into a backend database, significantly reducing the performance overhead. This service ensures that data will not be lost in the event of a failure.</p>
                <p>A mirror service can be attached to an application, providing fine-grained control of the objects that need to be persisted, without affecting the real-time portion of the app in either configuration or code. The mirror does not require a backup instance since it does not maintain any state. The actual state of the latest committed database transaction is stored within the primary and the backup space instances, not in the mirror.</p>
                <p>&#160;</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">

                <p style="text-align: center;font-style: italic;">Mirror Service (Write Behind)</p>
                <h2>Scaling</h2>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> delivers a scaling process that offers almost no downtime while the system scales. This scaling can be performed both horizontally and vertically, enabling the increase or reduction of the number of partitions allocated to a service.</p>
                <p>Vertical scaling allows the increase or decrease of the amount of RAM and CPU for an active GigaSpaces cluster – such as the addition of memory or CPUs to an existing physical node - without downtime. Vertical scaling offers many advantages:</p>
                <p>Resources are located in close physical proximity, enabling faster access to related data such as credit/debit tables that are updated in a closed (atomic) unit of work</p>
                <p>A performance gain, because more RAM and CPUs are available for each update</p>
                <p>Horizontal scaling allows adding and reducing the number of partitions used for an application, such as the creation of additional partitions in the same server, or the addition/removal of servers. Horizontal scaling supports linear increases in capacity on-the-fly; RAM or CPU capacity can be increased or decreased while maintaining a constant RAM/CPU ratio.</p>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> supports the full SQL-99 standard, allowing complex queries to be performed with optimal speed and minimal memory footprint. Standard SQL requests used for relational data manipulation can be used without requiring source code changes. Using Java and .NET APIs, advanced capabilities are available — such as object store, and various data modeling options.</p>
                <h2>Management of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /></h2>
                <p>The REST Manager API and UI tools enable management of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> cluster in Kubernetes deployments, providing typical information (such as parameters and responses) for each operation. This API  enables administration of local, remote, and cloud-based application environments.</p>
                <h3>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h3>
                <p>The <a href="../admin/tools-cli.html">GigaSpaces CLI</a> enables users to administer local, remote, and cloud-based application environments, and for maintenance tasks. The CLI is based on the REST Manager API.</p>
                <h2>Supported APIs</h2>
                <h3>Java Integration</h3>
                <p>The Java SDK offers the best expected performance, with full coverage of Space interfaces and functions.</p>
                <h3>.NET Integration</h3>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductXAP" /> supports C# on .NET Framework and .NETCore so that developers can perform all required operations within the Space in .NET.</p>
                <p>Server-side Java and client-side .Net operations available in Java can be performed in .NET.</p>
                <p>The data is saved in Java within the Space. The .NET Integration supports C# on both .NET Framework and .NETCore.</p>
                <h3>JDBC / ODBC</h3>
                <p>To connect with the Space, the GigaSpaces JDBC API  allows applications to interact with the Space, using JDBC or ODBC drivers. A query processor transparently translates SQL queries into legal Space operations. No integration is required, the application can just point to the GigaSpaces JDBC driver like any other JDBC driver.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
