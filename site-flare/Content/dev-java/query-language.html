            <p>JDBC V1 is similar in its performance and its coverage to the GigaSpaces API. </p>
            <p>JDBC V3 has full ANSI-SQL coverage,however it is more complex but the performance of simple queries will be slightly less than JDBC V1. </p>
            <p>In addition, JDBC&#160;V3 has support for ODBC and JDBC Postgress flavors.</p>
