A logs dump can be retrieved for the alert's related grid components.
This can be done by opening the Alert Actions menu and clicking "Generate dump...", after which, a window will appear providing configuration of the dump:

The events time-line shows the deployment life cycle of all the processing units.

#### Life-cycle success events for each instance:

- installation attempt : an attempt to provision a processing unit instance on an available GSC
- instance added: a processing unit instance has successfully been instantiated on a GSC
- instance uninstalled: a processing unit instance has been successfully removed
- Container N/A: a processing unit instance is pending instantiation until an available GSC is discovered

#### Life-cycle success events for processing unit:

- installation succeeded: deployment of processing unit has been completed successfully (all instances instantiated)
- installation uninstalled: undeployment of processing unit has been completed (all instances undeployed)

#### Life-cycle failure events for each instance:

- installation failed: processing unit instance has failed to instantiate
- installation unresponsive: processing unit instance is unresponsive to "member-is-alive" attempts (suspecting failure)
- installation crashed: processing unit instance unresponsiveness has timed-out (detected failure)
- installation re-detected: processing unit instance was previously unresponsive but is now responsive.
