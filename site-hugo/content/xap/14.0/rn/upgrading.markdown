If you are currently using a previous version of XAP or InsightEdge, contact <support@gigaspaces.com> for information on how to upgrade to the most recent [version](https://www.gigaspaces.com/download-center).

As a best practice, when upgrading to the latest version, unzip the downloaded software package and port the necessary changes from your previous environment into your new environment. It is recommended to use the new distribution as-is. 
 
# Backwards Compatibility

This version of the InsightEdge Platform is backwards compatible to XAP version 12.x (APIs and client-server). For more information about GigaSpaces' backwards compatibility policy, refer to the [Product Life Cycle and End-of-Life Policy](/release_notes/lifecycle.html) page.

For information about product changes that may affect your upgrade process, refer to the sections on Upgrading from a Previous Version for the following releases: [12.3](/xap/12.3/rn/upgrading.html), [12.2](/xap/12.2/rn/upgrading.html), [12.1](/release_notes/121upgrading.html), and [12.0](/release_notes/120upgrading.html).
