# clean

#### Syntax

    gs> space clean [variable [value]]

#### Description

Removes all Entries and templates from the space.

The `space clean` command is relevant only for spaces in a started state.

{{% tip %}}
When using a persistent space, the clean operation might take some time because it needs to erase data and close database connections. It should not be called when other clients are using the space.
{{% /tip %}}

Specifying a container URL prints a numbered list of all the spaces in the container. You can then choose which space to clear, or `all` (clears all spaces).

Specifying a URL of a clustered space prints a list of all spaces in the cluster, and you can choose a space to clear by its number, or `all` (lists all spaces).

{{% tip %}}
Using `-c` (or `-cluster`) with a URL of a clustered space clears **all** cluster members.
{{% /tip %}}

#### Options
