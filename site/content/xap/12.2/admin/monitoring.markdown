 You can [monitor the network and usage activity](./monitoring-network-activity.html) for XAP and your deployed applications during runtime. This is done via the proprietery [LRMI](./tuning-communication-protocol.html) communication protocol.
 
 Additionally, you can set up monitoring of specific services using [JMX](./space-jmx-management.html) to access the JConsole. You can also use any of the recommended [monitoring tools](./suggested-monitoring-tools.html) to track memory and CPU usage, heap memory usage, garbage collection, etc.
