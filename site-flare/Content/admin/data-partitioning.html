        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Some of the features discussed on this page are not part of the open-source edition, and are only available in the licensed editions (starting with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAPPrem" />).</p>

        <p>For an explanation of Data Partitioning concepts, refer to <a href="../started/data-partitioning.html">Data Partitioning </a>page in our Architectural Overview section.</p>
        <h1><a name="hash-based-load-balancing"></a>Hash-Based Load Balancing</h1>
        <p>This is the <span class="tc-bold">default mode</span> and applicable for most of the application. When using a hash-based load balancing policy, the client proxy spreads new written space objects into relevant cluster space nodes. The relevant space to rout the operation is determined using a space object routing field (also called a routing index) value hash code. This value, together with the number of the cluster partitions, is used to calculate the target space for the operation.</p><pre><code class="language-java">Target partition space ID = safeABS(routing field hashcode) % (# of partitions)

int safeABS( int value)
{
     return value == Integer.MIN_VALUE ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : Math.abs(value);
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The routing field must implement the <code>hashCode</code> method and will be used both when performing write and read operations. When using this approach the assumption is there is normal distribution of routing field values to have even distribution of the data across all the cluster partitions.</p>
        <p>Getting the number of partitions can be done via:</p><pre><code class="language-java">Admin admin = new AdminFactory().discoverUnmanagedSpaces().addLocator(locators).createAdmin();
int partitionCount = admin.getSpaces().waitFor("MyDataGridName", 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS).getPartitions().length;
</code></pre>
        <div class="tc-admon-tip">
            <ul>
                <li>It is recommended to use an Integer or a Long field type as the routing field.</li>
                <li>The default routing field is the space ID field. In this case, make sure you have the @SpaceId using the <code>autoGenarate=false</code> mode.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="tc-admon-important">
            <p>Converting a numeric value to a String and using the string representation as the routing key will give different load balancing in comparison to a numeric value.</p>
        </div>
        <h1><a name="example"></a>Example</h1>
        <p>A cluster is defined with 3 partitions, where each partition has one primary and one backup space.</p>
        <div class="tc-align-center">

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>The cluster is configured to use the hash-based load balancing policy. The application writes the <code>Account</code> space object into the clustered space. The <code>accountID</code> field as part of the <code>Account</code> class is defined as the routing field using the <code>@SpaceRouting</code> decoration.</p>
        <p>The Account class implementation:</p><pre><code class="language-java">@SpaceClass
public class Account
{
    Integer accountID;
    String accountName;

    @SpaceRouting
    public Integer getAccountID()
    {
    return accountID;
    }

    public String getAccountName()
    {
        return accountName;
    }
    // setter methods
    ...
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The <code>accountID</code> field value is used by the space client proxy together with the number partitions in the following manner to determine the target space for the write, read, or take operations:</p><pre><code class="language-java">Target Space number = (accountID hashCode value) modulo (Partitions Amount)
</code></pre>
        <p>If we will write 30 Account space objects with different <code>accountID</code> values into the cluster, the space objects will be routed into the 3 partitions in the following manner:</p>
        <div class="tc-align-center">
            <img src="../Resources/Static/attachment_files/load_balancing2.jpg" alt="load_balancing2.jpg" class="tc-picture50" />
        </div>
        <div class="tc-admon-tip">
            <p>If the relevant target space or its backup space is not active an error message will be thrown.</p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>A Parallel operation on the client means that the partition proxy will run a thread against each of its constituent partition proxies, each thread executing the operation (take , read). Corollary: every partition will experience a read/take multiple. No partition can guarantee that it will supply objects that the application client obtains in its result.</li>
            <li>A Serial operation on the client means that the partition proxy will execute one read/take multiple on each partition, the partitions being accessed in partition number order, 0 through max partition number. The readMultiple/takeMultiple will complete as soon as the requisite number of objects has been read/taken, or all partitions accessed, whichever comes soonest. Corollary: only partition 0 can guarantee that it will experience a readMultiple/takeMultiple - i.e. according to the member ID - Each partition has a numeric running ID associated with it and the processing done according their order(0 to N).</li>
            <li>When executing custom queries against partitioned space (triggers the space filter) you should use the takeMultiple or readMultiple with Integer.MAX_VALUE as the max values to execute the filter operation in parallel across the partitions.</li>
            <li>WriteMultipe/UpdateMultiple with a transaction executed in parallel manner.</li>
            <li>When calling any of the batch operations with a template and set the routing id in the template (making sure all the space objects go to the same physical space in a cluster) you do not need to use jini transaction. Local transaction will suffice.</li>
            <li>readMultiple/takeMultiple against any single partition is a synchronous call in the associated partition specific client proxy. The space operation is a synchronous operation. It will return as many requested objects as are currently present in the space, up to the number requested. If no objects are matched an empty array is returned.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><a name="considerations"></a>Considerations</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The replication scheme does not take into account the <code>IReplicatable</code> (partial replication) and replication matrix.</li>
            <li>All objects with a given routing value will be stored in the <span class="tc-italic">same partition</span>. This means that a given partition <span class="tc-italic">must</span> be able to hold all similarly-routed objects. If the routing value does not have uniform distribution, the partitioning will be uneven. Use a derived routing field (such as ID field) as the routing field value that gives a flat distribution across all nodes, if possible.</li>
