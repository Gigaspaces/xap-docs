This section describes the main activities that should be performed before moving your system into production. Read the section carefully and implement the relevant recommendations in order to build a stable environment and reduce the probability of unexpected behavior or even failures that may result from an application environment that has not been planned or configured appropriately.

In general, InsightEdge and XAP run on any operating system that supports JVM technology (Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP, etc.). 

Review the tuning and configuration recommendations described here that are required by most of the applications running over InsightEdge and XAP.

The following topics are covered:

- System architecture:
 - [Hardware Selection](./production-hardware-selection.html)
 - [Virtualized OS](./production-virtualized-os.html)
 - [Network Considerations](./production-network-requirements.html)
 - [Capacity Planning](./production-capacity-planning.html)
 - [Resource Sharing](./production-resource-sharing.html)
 
- Application configuration:
 - [Local Cache Policy](./production-local-cache-policy.html)
 - [Failover Considerations](./production-failover-considerations.html)
 - [File Descriptors](./production-file-descriptors.html)
 - [JVM Tuning](./production-jvm-tuning.html)
 - [XAP Considerations](./production-xap-considerations.html)
 
-  [Monitoring](./production-monitoring.html)
