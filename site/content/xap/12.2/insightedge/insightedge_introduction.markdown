## Overview

The unified InsightEdge solution, a combination of the XAP in-memory data grid and an open-source analytics ecosystem, is an open-source, in-memory insight platform that supports fast-data analytics, artificial intelligence and real-time applications. Customers can use this platform to develop their own systems that provide instant data-driven insights with time-to-analytics at a sub-second scale, and the ability to hyperscale analytics from SQL, streaming to machine learning via Apache Spark.

The InsightEdge Platform provides extreme performance with ultra-low latency, high-throughput transactions and stream processing, due to the co-location of applications and analytics. All of this functionality is available in a cloud-native, infrastructure-agnostic deployment for hybrid cloud and on-premises environments. 

The full InsightEdge Platform offers the following additional benefits:

* Multi-tiered data storage across RAM, SSD, and Storage-Class Memory (3DXPoint) 

* High availability (up to 5 nines) with auto-healing

* Disaster recovery via geo-redundancy, fast data replication and native persistence

## Licensing Options

InsightEdge is available in Java and .NET flavors, and offers several licensed editions, along with XAP and InsightEdge open-source editions. You can download a free 90-day trial version of any of the following:

* XAP Premium - Provides all the functionality of the open-source package, plus high availability and convenient management features (including the Service Grid user interface).

* XAP Enterprise - Builds on the XAP Premium package, adding the MemoryXtend feature (supporting SSD/flash memory and Off-Heap RAM) and Multi-Site WAN Replication for geo-redundancy.

* InsightEdge Platform - Offers the full functionality of InsightEdge and the XAP Enterprise edition, along with additional features such as full SQL-99 compatibility.

When the trial period is over, you can continue to benefit from the open-source functionality, or contact GigaSpaces support to purchase a license for the edition that best suits your needs.
