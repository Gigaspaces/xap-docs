        <h1><a name="enabling-security"></a>Enabling Security</h1>
        <p>Data grid security is enabled by setting the <code class="language-bash">gs.security.enabled</code>system property.
Append  the property to <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Version.14-5-died"><code>EXT_JAVA_OPTIONS</code></MadCap:conditionalText><code MadCap:conditions="Version.14-5-born">XAP_OPTIONS_EXT </code>in the <code>setenv-overides</code> script. The following example sets the property along with other optional security parameters.</p><pre><code class="language-java">-Dcom.gs.security.enabled=true -Dcom.gs.security.userid=xxx -Dcom.gs.security.password=yyy -Dcom.gigaspaces.webui.username.mandatory=true </code></pre>
        <p>This property affects the GSA, GSM, and GSC.

        <h1><a name="grid-service-agent"></a>Grid Service Agent</h1>
        <p>The <a href="../overview/the-runtime-environment.html#gsa">Grid Service Agent (GSA)</a> acts as a process manager that can spawn and manage Service Grid processes (GSM, GSC, etc.). When GSA is secured, a spawned GSM/GSC will also be secured. To <span class="tc-italic">start</span>, <span class="tc-italic">kill</span>, <span class="tc-italic">restart</span> a process you need <span class="tc-bold">Manage Grid</span> privileges.</p>
        <h1><a name="grid-service-manager"></a>Grid Service Manager</h1>
        <p>The <a href="../overview/the-runtime-environment.html#gsm">Grid Service Manager (GSM)</a> is responsible for managing Processing Units and Grid Service Containers. The GSM accepts deployment and un-deployment requests of Processing Units, and provisions them to GSCs. To <span class="tc-italic">deploy</span>and <span class="tc-italic">un-deploy</span> you need <span class="tc-bold">Provision PU</span> privileges.</p>
        <p>A secured GSM can <span class="tc-bold">only</span> connect to another secured GSM. This means that a Processing Unit managed by a secured GSM can be recoverable upon failover only by another secured GSM.</p>
        <h1><a name="xap-manager"></a><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> Manager</h1>
        <p>The <a href="../admin/xap-manager.html"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductNameXAP" /> Manager</a> is a component which stacks together the LUS and GSM along with ZooKeeper and a <a href="../admin/xap-manager-rest.html">RESTful Management API</a>.
The privileges of the GSM are the same as if it were standalone. For each REST operation, we list the required privilege in the yaml file, also viewable in the Swagger tool (see <a href="../admin/xap-manager-rest.html">RESTful API</a>).
For example, starting a container would require <span class="tc-bold">Manage Grid</span> privileges. Deploying a Space or a Processing Unit would require <span class="tc-bold">Provision PU</span> privileges.
For more information about using the RESTful API with security, refer to <a href="../admin/admin-rest-manager-api.html#security">REST Manager API - Security</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="elastic-processing-units"></a>Elastic Processing Units</h2>
        <p>When an <a href="../dev-java/elastic-processing-unit-overview.html">Elastic Processing Unit</a> is deployed, the GSM performs the initial provisioning and the <span class="tc-italic">ESM</span> monitors it to ensure the elastic requirements are met. This means that when the service grid is secured, the ESM requires credentials with <span class="tc-italic">Manage PU</span> and <span class="tc-italic">Manage Grid</span> permissions to monitor and manage the elastic processing units. This is done using the <code>com.gs.esm.username</code> and <code>com.gs.esm.password</code> system properties.</p>
        <h1><a name="grid-service-container"></a>Grid Service Container</h1>
        <p>A <a href="../overview/the-runtime-environment.html#gsc">Grid Service Container (GSC)</a> is a container which hosts deployed Processing Unit Instances, and reports its status to the GSM. In general, operations on the GSC are routed to the managing GSM of the processing unit. To <span class="tc-italic">scale up/down</span>, <span class="tc-italic">relocate</span>, <span class="tc-italic">restart PU instance</span>, <span class="tc-italic">destroy PU instance</span> you need <span class="tc-bold">Manage PU</span> privileges.</p>
        <p>A secured GSC can <span class="tc-bold">only</span> connect to a secured GSM. This means that a Processing Unit managed by a secured GSM can only be provisioned to a secured GSC.</p>
        <div class="tc-admon-note">
            <p>Security of a GSC does not enforce any security on the deployed Processing Unit. i.e., a secured GSC can contain a Processing unit with a non-secured Space, and a non-secured GSC can contain a Processing Unit with a secured Space.</p>
